# Elastic Path SDKs (Next Generation)

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: These TypeScript SDKs are currently under active development and represent the next generation of Elastic Path's client libraries. They are not yet ready for production use.

## Overview

This package contains the next version of Elastic Path's TypeScript SDKs, built from the ground up to provide:

- Improved type safety and TypeScript support
- Better performance and smaller bundle sizes
- Consistent API across different platforms
- Enhanced developer experience

## Status

These SDKs are currently in development and should be considered alpha quality. We recommend using our current stable SDKs for production applications:

- [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elasticpath/js-sdk)

## Future Updates

We'll update this README with more information as development progresses. Stay tuned for:

- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API documentation
- Migration guides from existing SDKs

## Questions?

If you have any questions about these upcoming SDKs, please reach out to our support team or open an issue in this repository.
