# Elastic Path SDKs (Next Generation)

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: These TypeScript SDKs are currently under active development and represent the next generation of Elastic Path's client libraries. They are not yet ready for production use.

## Overview

This package contains the next version of Elastic Path's TypeScript SDKs, built from the ground up to provide:

- Improved type safety and TypeScript support
- Better performance and smaller bundle sizes
- Consistent API across different platforms
- Enhanced developer experience

## Status

These SDKs are currently in development and should be considered alpha quality. We recommend using our current stable SDKs for production applications:

- [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elasticpath/js-sdk)

## Generator helpers

Resolvers shared by the packages' `openapi-ts.config.ts` live in `specs/heyapi/`.

### `int64AsNumber`

The Zod plugin emits `z.coerce.bigint()` for `int64` and `uint64` fields, while the generated TypeScript types and the API's JSON use `number`. `int64AsNumber` makes the `/zod` schemas parse those fields as `number`, with a string such as a query string value converted first.

- It clears `schema.format` on the schema it handles. The plugin builds the default value from `meta.format` after the resolver has run, and for `int64` that default is a `BigInt(...)`. Clearing the format is the only way to stop it.
- It relies on `typescript` and `sdk` running before `zod` in each config's plugin list. Those plugins have already read the format by the time `zod` clears it.
- `pim/test/int64-as-number.test.ts` generates a fixture with the helper and checks the result, so a generator upgrade that changes either behavior fails the test.

## Future Updates

We'll update this README with more information as development progresses. Stay tuned for:

- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API documentation
- Migration guides from existing SDKs
