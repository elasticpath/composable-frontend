  title: Commerce Extensions Introduction
  description: |
    Commerce Extensions is a Database as a Service (DBaaS) that allows for the creation of Custom APIs and extend the capabilities of Commerce. With Custom APIs, you can efficiently manage large data sets while benefiting from both simple and complex multidimensional filtering options. Combining Custom APIs with [Composer](/docs/composer/index) enables you to deploy custom behaviors and integrations, allowing you to implement capabilities unique to your business without having to build and host that functionality from scratch.

    Commerce Extensions is the next generation of Flows. Flows are not going anywhere, but going forward as we add new features, Commerce Extensions will eventually provide all the capabilities and more that Flows does. We recommend using Custom APIs for any of your new use cases.

      Custom APIs allow you to extend the capabilities of Commerce. With Custom APIs, you can efficiently manage large data sets while benefiting from both simple and complex multidimensional filtering options. Combining Custom APIs with [Composer](/docs/composer/index) enables you to deploy custom behaviors and integrations, allowing you to implement capabilities unique to your business without having to build and host that functionality from scratch.

      A Custom API is composed of one or more [Custom Fields](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/custom-fields) and allows you to create [Entries](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/custom-api-entries). In database terms, a Custom API can be thought of as a table, with fields representing the columns of the table, and entries serving as the database records.

      ## Custom APIs vs Non-Core Flows

      Custom APIs are the next generation of Non-Core Flows. Here is a comparison of current features of Non-Core Flows and Custom APIs. This will be updated as we release more capabilities.

      ## Validation

      When [creating](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/create-a-custom-field#request) or [updating](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/update-a-custom-field#request) a Custom Field, `validation` can be used to limit the values that may be stored in the corresponding Custom API Entry.

      :::note

      All validation changes, such as those to `allow_null_values` and any type specific rules, apply to new entries only. Existing Custom API Entry records are unaffected until updated.

      :::

      ### Integer Validation
      - `min_value`: Specifies the minimum whole number that can be stored. If set, it must be less than `max_value`.
      - `max_value`: Specifies the maximum whole number that can be stored. If set, it must be greater than `min_value`.

      sample integer validation object:

      ```json
      {
        "validation": {
          "integer": {
            "min_value": 0,
            "max_value": 32
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      Even if no validation is set, field_type `integer` only supports values between -2^53+1 and 2^53+1. This is because the JSON format doesn't guarantee that values outside this range are portable ([Source](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159#section-6)).



      ### Float Validation
      - `min_value`: Specifies the minimum number that can be stored. If set, it must be less than `max_value`.
      - `max_value`: Specifies the maximum number that can be stored. If set, it must be greater than `min_value`.

      sample float validation object:

      ```json
      {
        "validation": {
          "float": {
            "min_value": 0.01,
            "max_value": 32.01
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      The `float` field_type cannot accurately represent some numbers and so using very small or large numbers might lose precision. We recommend that API clients use either the `integer` field_type if applicable , or the `string` data type if perfect precision or recall is required.

      ### String Validation
      - `min_length`: Specifies the minimum number of characters that can be stored. If set, it must be greater than 0 and less than `max_length`.
      - `max_length`: Specifies the maximum number of characters that can be stored. If set, it must be greater than 0 and `min_length`.
      - `regex`: An [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regular expression used to restrict the specific characters that can be stored. It must be less than 1024 characters.
      - `unique`: Specifies whether the field must have unique constraint or not. It must be `yes` or `no`.
      - `unique_case_insensitivity`: Applies when `unique` is set to `yes`. It controls whether values with different cases (for example, `ABC` and `abc`) should conflict. It must be `true` or `false`.
      sample string validation object:

      ```json
      {
        "validation": {
          "string": {
            "min_length": 0,
            "max_length": 64,
            "regex": "^.+\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|pdf)$",
            "unique": "yes"
            "unique_case_insensitivity": true
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      Even if no validation is set, field_type `string` only supports values that are up to `65535` characters long.

      #### Date & Time Values With Regular Expressions

      While Commerce Extensions does not have a native date or time type, you can none-the-less use these values in Commerce Extensions, by using the `string` field type and `regex` validation. To ensure that
      ordering is handled properly you should follow the guidance in [RFC 3339 - Section 5.1 Ordering](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.1), namely store the fields in order of least to most precise,
      and in the same timezone, this will ensure that comparison operators (e.g., `gt`) and sorting, work as expected, for example the following regex will force all values to be in seconds in UTC: `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}Z$`

      One thing to keep in mind is that some libraries, especially when dealing with sub-seconds might only display them if they are non-zero, and you will want to ensure that they are fully padded to the same length.

      #### Enum Values with Regular Expressions

      You can ensure that only some values are allowed using the regular expression `^(alpha|bravo|charlie)$`.

      #### Slug Values with Regular Expressions

      Slugs can be replaced with the regular expression `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`, this will ensure that the field starts with a lower case letter, and then has lower case letters, numbers or hyphens. You can tweak this regular expression as needed to suit your needs.

      ### Email Validation with Regular Expressions

      E-mails can be tricky to validate properly, especially because many services _accept_ e-mails that are not valid, and reject e-mail addresses that are technically valid. Additionally, your own capabilities and purposes might inform your decision (e.g., if you support [i18n addresses](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6530) or don't then the set of allowed e-mails changes).

      ### List Validation
      - `min_length`: Specifies the minimum number of elements that must be in the list.
      - `max_length`: Specifies the maximum number of elements allowed in the list. The maximum supported value is 1000.
      - `allowed_type`: Specifies the primitive type that all elements in the list must be. Valid values are `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `float`, or `any`. The default is `any`, which allows mixed types. This value cannot be changed after the field is created.

      sample list validation object:

      ```json
      {
        "validation": {
          "list": {
            "min_length": 1,
            "max_length": 100,
            "allowed_type": "string"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ### Any Validation

      The `any` field type allows storing arbitrary JSON values including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null. When updating an entry, the `any` field value is completely replaced, not merged. Filtering is not supported on `any` fields.

      sample any validation object:

      ```json
      {
        "validation": {
          "any": {
            "allow_null_values": true,
            "immutable": false
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ### Null Values

      All Custom Fields can be configured to restrict the storage of `null` values for that field on a Custom API Entry. By default, this is `true`.

      sample validation object :

      ```json
      {
        "validation": {
          "boolean": {
            "allow_null_values": false,
            "immutable": false
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ### Immutable

      When [creating](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/create-a-custom-field#request) a Custom Field, it can be configured to be `immutable`. When set to true, the value of this field can be specified only during POST requests and cannot be modified during PUT requests. By default, this is `false`.

      sample validation object :

      ```json
      {
        "validation": {
          "boolean": {
            "immutable": false
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ## Presentation

      When [creating](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/create-a-custom-field#request) or [updating](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/update-a-custom-field#request) a Custom Field, `presentation` can be used to influence the layout and order of fields within Commerce Manager. It does not affect the order of keys within JSON, nor influence any behaviour outside of Commerce Manager.

      ## Reserved Slugs

      The following values cannot be used as a `slug` in a Custom Field.

      - slug
      - type
      - id
      - meta
      - created_at
      - updated_at
      - links
      - relationships
      - attributes
      - attribute
      - dimension
      - dimensions
      - weight
      - weights

  - name: Custom API Entries
    # language=Markdown
    description: |
      A **Custom API Entry** is a specific instance of a resource, such as a single wishlist in a Custom API for wishlists.

      Custom API Entries can be accessed in two different ways, via the **extension** endpoint, or the **settings** endpoint:

      * Extension Endpoint: `/v2/extensions/{custom_api_slug}` - This is the primary endpoint created for use. Most clients should use this endpoint as it adheres to the semantics of the configuration. See [Commerce Extension Custom API](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/commerce-extension-custom-api)
      * Settings Endpoint: `/v2/settings/extensions/custom-apis/{custom_api_id}/entries/` - This endpoint should only be used in cases where you want to interact with your Custom APIs in a generic way in an admin capacity.

      Currently, the distinction between these endpoints is minimal. The extension endpoint uses a slug in the URL path, and the settings endpoint uses an ID. For most use cases involving the new Custom API, we recommend using the extension endpoint.

      Conceptually, the settings endpoint is analogous to reflection in most programming languages. You use it when you want to operate in a generic way. For example, we used the settings endpoint to build Commerce Manager. Another example is if you need to import and export various types of data from CSV files. Instead of writing multiple scripts for different extension endpoints, you can write one script that operates on the settings endpoint.

      ## Events

      You can integrate Commerce Extensions with your external systems by observing the appropriate events. For more information, see [Integrations](/docs/api/integrations/integrations-introduction).

      Given you have a Custom API with `api_type` of `wishlist_ext` and you want to perform additional processing when an action is taken, like when a wishlist is created:

      ```bash
      curl -X POST https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/v2/extensions/wishlists \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d $ {
          "data": {
            "type": "wishlist_ext",
            "name": "My Wishlist",
            "items_count": 0,
            "keep_purchased": false
          }
        }
      ```

      When you [create an integration](/docs/api/integrations/create-integration) with `wishlist_ext.created` in `observes` field.
      Then the configured `webhook` or `aws_sqs` will receive the appropriate message.

      You can configure integrations to observe the following events for your Custom API Entries:
      * Created
      * Updated
      * Deleted

  - name: Commerce Extension Custom API
    # language=Markdown

        ## Filtering
        The following operators and attributes are available for [filtering](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering) Custom APIs:

          | Attribute     | Operators                     | Example                                       |

          | `description` | `eq`,`like`                   | `like(description,*list*)`                   |
          | `slug`        | `eq`,`like`,`in`              | `like(slug,*lists)`                           |
          | `api_type`    | `eq`,`like`,`in`              | `like(api_type,wishlist*)`                    |
          | `id`          | `lt`,`le`,`eq`,`gt`,`ge`,`in` | `eq(id,7e067539-6f6c-46e1-8c55-940031b36c6a)` |
          | `created_at`  | `lt`,`le`,`eq`,`gt`,`ge`      | `ge(created_at,2024-04-29T00:00:00.000Z)`     |

        ## Sorting
        The following attributes are available for sorting. When specified, the results are sorted in ascending order based on the value of the field. To sort in descending order, prefix the attribute with `-`, for example, `-updated_at`. The default sort order is `created_at` in descending order.
        - `name`
        - `slug`
        - `api_type`
        - `id`
        - `created_at`
        - `updated_at`

        ## Filtering
          The following operators and attributes are available for [filtering](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering) Custom Fields:

          | Attribute     | Operators                     | Example                                       |

          | `description` | `eq`,`like`                   | `like(description,*confidential*)`            |
          | `slug`        | `eq`,`like`,`in`              | `like(slug,*private*)`                        |

        ## Sorting
        The following attributes are available for sorting. When specified, the results are sorted in ascending order based on the value of the field. To sort in descending order, prefix the attribute with `-`, for example, `-updated_at`. The default sort order is `created_at` in descending order.
        - `name`
        - `slug`
        - `field_type`
        - `id`
        - `created_at`
        - `updated_at`

        Get all Custom API Entries

        ## Filtering
          The following operators and attributes are available for [filtering](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering) all Custom API Entries:

          | Attribute     | Operators                     | Example                                       |
          |---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
          | `id`          | `lt`,`le`,`eq`,`gt`,`ge`,`in` | `eq(id,859aeba1-03c2-4822-bd4c-89afce93d7eb)` |
          | `created_at`  | `lt`,`le`,`eq`,`gt`,`ge`      | `ge(created_at,2024-04-29T00:00:00.000Z)`     |
          | `updated_at`  | `lt`,`le`,`eq`,`gt`,`ge`      | `le(updated_at,2024-04-29T00:00:00.000Z)`     |

        The following operators and attributes may be available for filtering Custom API Entries depending on how the [Custom Fields](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/create-a-custom-field) for that Custom API are configured.

          | Field type | Operators                                      |
          |------------|------------------------------------------------|
          | `string`   | `lt`,`le`,`eq`,`gt`,`ge`,`in`,`is_null`,`like` |
          | `integer`  | `lt`,`le`,`eq`,`gt`,`ge`,`in`,`is_null`        |
          | `float`    | `lt`,`le`,`gt`,`ge`,`in`,`is_null`             |
          | `boolean`  | `eq`,`is_null`                                 |

          Given there is a Custom Field with `"slug": "name"` and `"field_type": "string"`.

          When you get all Custom API Entries with query parameter: `?filter=like(name,*wish*)`.

          Then you will get all Custom API Entries where `name` contains the string `wish`.

        :::warn

        For performance reasons, the `is_null` search operator will **NOT** match entries for a custom_field where the custom_entry was last updated before the custom_field existed. Updating the entry will cause the field to exist and match properly.

        :::


        ## Sorting
        The following attributes are available for sorting. When specified, the results are sorted in ascending order based on the value of the field. To sort in descending order, prefix the attribute with `-`, for example, `-updated_at`. The default sort order is `created_at` in descending order.
        - `id`
        - `created_at`
        - `updated_at`
      operationId: GetAllCustomEntries
      parameters:

          description: >-
            Specifies how long in milliseconds the request should be allowed to take. The service will return a
            422 if the request takes longer than the specified timeout.

    AnyCustomFieldAttributes:
      description: |
        The `any` field type allows storing arbitrary JSON values including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null. This provides maximum flexibility for storing complex or varying data structures.

        **Important:** When updating an entry, the `any` field value is completely replaced, not merged. For example, if a field contains `{"a": 1, "b": 2}` and you update it with `{"a": 99}`, the result will be `{"a": 99}` (not `{"a": 99, "b": 2}`). Standard partial update behavior still applies at the entry level: if you omit the field entirely from an update request, the existing value is preserved.

        **Note:** Filtering is not supported on `any` fields.

      description: |
        The `list` field type allows storing an array of primitive values (strings, integers, booleans, floats, or null). The list can contain up to 1000 elements.

        ### Filtering

        List fields support the following filter operators:

        **List Content Operators** (operate on the entire list):
        - `contains(field, value)` - matches entries where the list contains the specified value
        - `contains_any(field, value1, value2, ...)` - matches entries where the list contains any of the specified values
        - `contains_all(field, value1, value2, ...)` - matches entries where the list contains all of the specified values (**requires `allowed_type` to not be `any`**)
        - `is_null(field)` - matches entries where the list field is null

        **Index-Based Access** (access specific elements by position):
        - `eq(field[index], value)` - matches entries where the element at the specified index equals the value
        - `like(field[index], pattern)` - matches entries where the string element at the index matches the pattern
        - `in(field[index], value1, value2, ...)` - matches entries where the element at the index is one of the specified values
        - `is_null(field[index])` - matches entries where the element at the index is null
        - `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge(field[index], value)` - relational comparisons (**requires `allowed_type` to not be `any`**)

        Index must be a non-negative integer from 0 to 999. Negative indices are not supported.

        **Length Access** (filter by array length):
        - `eq(field.length, value)` - matches entries where the list has exactly the specified length
        - `lt(field.length, value)`, `le(field.length, value)` - matches entries where the list length is less than (or equal to) the value
        - `gt(field.length, value)`, `ge(field.length, value)` - matches entries where the list length is greater than (or equal to) the value
        - `in(field.length, value1, value2, ...)` - matches entries where the list length is one of the specified values

        ### Typed Lists vs Untyped Lists

        When `allowed_type` is set to a specific type (e.g., `"string"`, `"integer"`), additional operators become available:
        - `contains_all` - efficiently matches all specified values using exact type comparison
        - Relational operators (`lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`) on index access - compare values with proper type handling

        When `allowed_type` is `"any"` (the default), these operators are not available because type coercion would make comparisons unreliable.

        ### Type Coercion (Untyped Lists)

        For lists with `allowed_type: "any"`, filter operators use type coercion to match values:
        - `contains(field, 1)` matches both integer `1` and string `"1"`
        - `contains(field, true)` matches both boolean `true` and string `"true"`
        - `eq(field[0], 1)` matches both integer `1` and string `"1"` at index 0

        ### Type Mismatch Behavior (Typed Lists)

        For operators that require exact type matching (`contains_all`, `in` on typed fields), filtering with a value that cannot be converted to the `allowed_type` returns a 400 error. For example, `contains_all(field, "foo")` on an integer list returns an error because `"foo"` cannot be converted to an integer.

        For operators that use type coercion (`contains`, `contains_any`), filtering with a non-matching type returns zero results. For example, `contains(field, "foo")` on an integer list returns no matches because the string `"foo"` doesn't match any integers in the list.

        **Note:** Float elements in lists are not reliably filterable with `eq()` due to floating-point precision issues.

        **Note:** If a field slug matches the index access pattern (e.g., `myfield[0]`) or length access pattern (e.g., `myfield.length`), filtering on that field may not work as expected. To avoid conflicts, use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens in field slugs.
