  title: Addresses Introduction
  description: |
    The Addresses API allows you to organize account addresses. Addresses are a sub-resource of `account` resources, an account can have multiple addresses, such as home, work, and neighbour.
    
    You can use an account address with either [client_credentials access token](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token) or a combination of [implicit access token](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token) and [Account Management authentication](/docs/api/accounts/post-v-2-account-members-tokens) token.
