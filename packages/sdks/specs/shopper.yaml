  description: >
    Use the catalog-view Service API to create your catalogs.
                  
    You also have the flexibility to create catalogs for different scenarios by
    combining hierarchies of products with a price book. Scenarios might
    include:


    - Multiple geographical regions. Display different catalogs in different
    regions with suitable pricing or combine product hierarchies from two
    different regions to display in a third region.

    - Multiple channels. Display different catalogs based on how a shopper
    accesses your store, such as through a mobile app or a web storefront.

    - Direct to business versus direct to customers. Offer different products
    and prices for business customers versus retail customers.

    - Preferred customers. Offer special pricing to preferred customers while
    displaying a standard price catalog to all other shoppers.

    - Reward programs. Enable reward programs where catalog prices drop after a
    certain spending level is reached.

    - Product sales. Offer sale items for a limited time.
     
    Scenarios are created by defining the context within which a catalog is
    displays. Contexts can be a customer ID, a channel, or any other
    user-defined tag that can be passed to the APIs from the front-end shopper
    experiences.

      A catalog contains the products available for sale either in your
      organization or store. A catalog also contains information about how to
      organize those products for navigation menus and search facets in a
      shopper experience.


      Before you create a catalog you must define the following resources:


      - Hierarchies: hierarchies and nodes to categorize the products. See
      [**Hierarchies**](/docs/api/pxm/products/hierarchies).

      - Products: product information, associated assets, and links to hierarchy
      nodes. See [**Products**](/docs/api/pxm/products/products).

      - Price Books: prices for the products associated with the hierarchies.
      See [**Price Books**](/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks).


      A catalog is a combination of hierarchies and a price book.
       
      ### Products
       
      Commerce automatically assigns types to the products you create. Product
      types can be used in catalogs. For example, in your catalog, you can
      filter on `parent` so that only your parent products are displayed in your
      storefront.
       
      You can use product tags to store or assign a key word against a product
      or service that you sell in your store. The product tag can then be used
      to describe or label that product. Product tags represent similarities
      between products who do not share the same attributes. Using product tags
      means that you can group your products together, for example, by brand,
      category, subcategory, colors, types, industries, and so on. Product tags
      can be used in catalogs. For example, you can categorize your products
      based on color. Your shoppers can then search your products by color,
      enabling shoppers to quickly find what they are looking for, increasing
      the likelihood of a purchase, and boosting conversion rates.
       
      ### Hierarchies
       
      The hierarchies determine which products appear in the catalog, that is,
      only the products that are associated with the selected hierarchies are
      included in the catalog. You can also specify the order you want your
      hierarchies to display in a published catalog. You can order your
      hierarchies on a catalog-by-catalog basis.

      For more information, see [**create a
      Catalog**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/create-catalog).
       
      #### Understanding How Products And Nodes Are Associated
       
      You can use `breadcrumb` metadata to understand how products and nodes are
      associated. it explains how products are associated with parent nodes and
      the relationship among the array of nodes. This is useful if you want to
      improve how your shoppers search within your store.
       
      The `breadcrumb` information that you get in an endpoint response depends
      on whether the endpoint is retrieving product or node details.
       
      |  Object |  Product/Node |  Description |

      | --- | --- | --- |

      | `breadcrumb` | Node | A list of nodes that a product is associated with.
      Up to 10 levels of nodes are displayed, depending on the number of levels
      of nodes you have. |

      | `bread_crumbs` | Product | The relationship among the array of nodes a
      product is associated with, demonstrating the linking of the children
      nodes with the parent nodes. Up to 10 levels of nodes are displayed,
      depending on the number of levels of nodes you have. |

      | `bread_crumb_nodes` | Product | An array of parent node IDs that a
      product is associated with. The `bread_crumb_node` metadata lists up to 10
      levels of parent nodes, depending on the number of levels of parent nodes
      you have. |
       
      #### Understanding `bread_crumbs` Metadata
       
      The following diagram illustrates a parent and child nodes.
       
      ![Breadcrumbs](/assets/breadcrumbs.PNG)
       
      1. The product is in **Node 2**. The ID for **Node 2** is shown first in
      the first set of breadcrumbs.

      1. **Node 2** is part of **Hierarchy 1**. The ID for **Hierarchy 1** is
      shown second.

      1. **Node 1** is the parent node of **Node 2**. The ID for **Node 1** is
      shown last.

      1. The product is also in **Node 3**. The ID for **Node 3** is shown first
      in the second set of breadcrumbs.

      1. **Node 3** is in the root of **Hierarchy 1**. The ID for **Hierarchy
      1** is shown last.
       
      In the `bread_crumb_nodes` metadata, you can see a list of parent nodes a
      product is associated with.
       
      If you subsequently add a product to a new node, then the
      `bread_crumb_nodes` metadata appends the new node to the top of the list.
      Using the example above, if we add the product to **Node 1**:
       
      1. The `bread_crumb_nodes` metadata is generated to show the new node
      appended to the top of the list.

      1. The `bread_crumbs` metadata is updated with the new node.
       
      #### Understanding Breadcrumb Metadata for Child Products
       
      When a catalog is published, the breadcrumb information for a child
      product includes the metadata mentioned for the parent product, in
      addition to the information specific to the child product. For example,
      **Product A** is the parent product, associated with **Node 1** and **Node
      2**. The metadata for child **Product B** includes **Node 1** and **Node
      2**, in addition to its own metadata information.
       
      ### Nodes
       
      The nodes determine which products appear under this in the catalog, that
      is, only the products that are associated with the selected node are shown
      under this node.
       
      ### Price books


      A price book contains the prices for each of the products in the catalog.
      You can create multiple price books for different scenarios, such as
      seasonal sales, business versus retail customer pricing, and reward
      programs. When creating a catalog, you can specify up to five price books.
      You must set a priority for your price books. Product prices are displayed
      in the catalog according to the priority of the price books. See [Create a
      catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/create-catalog).
    x-displayName: Catalogs
  - name: Releases
    description: >
      When a catalog is published, a catalog release is created. A catalog
      release provides a snapshot of the product information taken at the time
      of publication. You can have one or more catalog releases available in
      your organization or in your store. If you publish a catalog for your
      organization, the catalog is available when the store is launched.


      If you have more than one catalog published for your store, use catalog
      rules to specify when to display each catalog. For example, you can use
      [**catalog rules**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/rules) to schedule a catalog to
      appear during a particular date and time, such as a seasonal catalog. The
      catalog may have different pricing than the other catalogs.


      When a catalog is ready to be used in a store, you publish it. You can
      create and publish catalogs for different contexts and channels.


      Here are some pointers to understand a catalogs' lifecycle.


      - The default catalog is always the oldest published catalog and must have
      have at least one release.

      - At any time, the most recent three catalog releases are maintained.
      Hence, if there is a fourth catalog release, the first catalog release is
      automatically removed.

      - Until the catalog is published again, the previously created three
      catalog releases stay permanently.

      - If you want any other catalog to become the default catalog, you must
      create a catalog rule.

      - If you want the oldest published catalog to become the default catalog,
      you must remove the catalog rule.

      - Use the `sort_order` value in the `variations` to program your
      storefront to display the variation options in the order that you want.


      Here is a diagram that describes a catalogs' lifecycle:


      ![Catalogs' Lifecycle](/assets/catalog-lifecycle.png)
       
      ### Publishing catalogs
       
      When you publish a catalog, the `live` products in the hierarchies appear
      in a catalog release. A catalog release provides a snapshot of product
      information taken at the time of publication. You can have one or more
      catalog releases available in your organization or in your store. If you
      publish a catalog for your organization, the catalog is available when the
      store is launched.
       
      If you have more than one catalog published for your store, use catalog
      rules to specify when to display each catalog. For example, you can use
      [catalog rules](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/rules) to schedule a catalog to
      appear during a particular date and time, such as a seasonal catalog. The
      catalog may have different pricing than the other catalogs. You can have
      multiple published catalogs.
       
      When a catalog is ready to be used in a store, you publish it. You can
      create and publish catalogs for different contexts and channels. You can
      see the differences between the last two consecutive catalog releases. See
      [Publish a catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release).
       
      You retrieve catalogs for your shopper experience by using the [Catalog
      View API](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/releases).
    x-displayName: Releases
  - name: Rules
    description: >
      If your store requires multiple catalogs, add catalog rules to control
      when a catalog is displayed. A catalog rule contains a catalog plus the
      criteria under which to display the catalog.


      :::caution


      You cannot create catalog rules for organization catalogs.


      :::


      You can use catalog rules to schedule a catalog to appear during a
      particular period, such as on a specific date or during summer. The
      catalog might offer different pricing during this period. The pricing
      depends on the associated price book.


      The following scenarios provides a few examples for using catalog rules.


      - **Multiple geographical regions**. Display different catalogs in
      different regions with suitable pricing or combine product hierarchies
      from two different regions to display in a third region.

      - **Multiple channels**. Display different catalogs based on how a shopper
      accesses your store, such as through a mobile app or a web storefront.

      - **Direct to business versus direct to customers**. Offer different
      products and prices for business customers versus retail customers.

      - **Preferred accounts**. Offer special pricing to a group of users while
      displaying a standard price catalog to other users.

      - **Preferred customers**. Offer special pricing to preferred customers
      while displaying a standard price catalog to all other shoppers.

      - **Reward programs**. Enable reward programs where catalog prices drop
      after a certain spending level is reached.

      - **Product sales**. Offer sale items for a limited time.

      - **Standard pricing**. Display a default catalog to the shoppers who do
      not meet the criteria of the other catalog rules.


      You can define a catalog rule with any of the following criteria.


      - **Accounts**. List the accounts that should see a catalog. When a user
      has logged in with the account, they see the configured catalog.

      - **Customers**. List the customers that should see a catalog. When the
      customer is logged in, they see the configured catalog.

      - **Channel**. Specify a shopper experience, such as web storefront or
      mobile app. Set up the channel to retrieve the catalog from the catalog
      rule that matches that channel.

      - **Other tags**. Create your own user-defined tags. For example, you
      might want to tag by regions or you might want to distinguish between
      business and consumer customers.


      If a catalog rule has no criteria defined, it is the default catalog rule.


      ### Resolving catalog rules


      When there is a request for a catalog, the store displays the catalog with
      the rule that matches the most attributes of the shoppers context.


      The request triggers the following steps:


      1. Compares the shoppers context against the defined catalog rules.

      1. Determines the best match.

      1. Retrieves the catalog associated with the matching catalog rule.


      The follow examples show how the best match might be resolved:


      - A shopper matches one of the `customer_ids` in one catalog rule only.
      The catalog for that catalog rule is displayed.

      - A shopper matches one of the `customer_ids` in one catalog rule only,
      but doesnʼt match any of the `tags` specified in that catalog rule.
      Because there are no other catalog rules for this `customer_id`, the
      catalog for the catalog rule is displayed because it is the best match.

      - A shopper is browsing a store using the stores mobile app, which matches
      `channel=mobile` in two catalog rules. The catalog displayed depends on
      matches with the `tags` or `customer_ids` attributes. If there is no other
      matching attribute, the first catalog rule found by the store is used. The
      best practice is to create catalog rules that cover all cases so that you
      avoid this situation.

      - An unknown shopper is browsing the only channel offered by the seller.
      The store displays the base catalog.

      The Administrator Latest Releases Catalog View API is for Administrator
      use only. Do not use these endpoints on your customer-facing frontends.


      :::


      Publishing a catalog creates a release of that catalog that you can use in
      an organization or in a specific store or other shopper experience. You
      can retrieve the hierarchies, nodes, and the `live` products associated
      with a catalog release. You can see which parent nodes a product is
      associated with. This is useful if want to improve how your shoppers
      search your store, for example.


      Currently, published catalogs are limited to the current release and two
      releases prior to the current release.

      Use the Shopper Catalog View API to retrieve hierarchy, node and product
      information for a catalog release. When you publish a catalog for a store,
      you can define catalog rules so that you can show catalogs with different
      pricing or different products to preferred customers or channels. These
      endpoints can be used in your customer-facing frontends.


      A catalog is a combination of one or more hierarchies, products, and a
      price book. Use the Products API and Hierarchies API to create a hierarchy
      of products that can be included in a catalog. Use the Price Book API to
      associate prices with products.


      ### Characteristics of Shopper Catalogs


      Shopper catalogs can have the following characteristics.


      - Use catalog rules to schedule a catalog to appear during a particular
      date and time, such as a seasonal catalog. The catalog may have different
      pricing than the other catalogs. You can have multiple published catalogs.

      - If you have defined catalog rules and you want to retrieve a published
      catalog for a particular channel or a user-defined tag, you must set the
      appropriate headers in the request:
        - `EP-Channel` - The channel, such as website or mobile app. See [**Create a Catalog Rule**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/create-rule).
        - `EP-Context-Tag` - A tag defined in the store, such as `clearance`. See [**Create a Catalog Rule**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/create-rule).
      * When a catalog is ready to be used in a store, you publish it. See
      [**Publish a Catalog**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release).

      * You can create and publish catalogs for different contexts and channels.
      You can see the differences between the last 2 consecutive catalog
      releases. See [**Publish a
      Catalog**](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release).

      * You retrieve catalogs for your shopper experience by using the Shopper
      Catalog View API. For more information on how you can retrieve a catalog
      as a shopper using the Catalog API.

      * When a catalog is published for a store, the corresponding events
      contain `store_id` and `org_id`. 

      * When a catalog is published for an organization, the corresponding
      events contain `org_id`. 

      * Use the `sort_order` value in `variations` to program your storefront to
      display the variation options in the order that you want.


      ### Shopper Catalog Caching


      When conducting a `GET` on `catalog` endpoints, all data returned,
      including catalog releases, products, nodes and hierarchies, are cached
      for 5 minutes. This means, if you call the same endpoint again, the
      catalog data is retrieved from the cached objects pool, optimizing the
      performance and efficiency of your store front.


      If you use any of the `catalog` endpoints with a `filter` or `include`
      query parameter, these are cached separately. 


      The cached entries disappear from the cached objects pool after 5 minutes.

      A Cart contains the product and custom cart items that a user intends to
      purchase. After a Cart is ready for Checkout, you can use the [Checkout
      endpoint](/docs/api/carts/checkout) to convert the cart to an order.


      :::note


      - Adding, modifying, or removing any cart items, custom items, or
      promotions always returns the cart meta, calculated using the calculation
      method. This is useful to update the client with up-to-date totals.

      - We will automatically delete carts 7 days after they were last updated.

      - If you do not pass a `X-MOLTIN-CURRENCY` header specifying what currency
      you would like the cart to use, the products in the cart are converted to
      your default currency.

      The checkout workflow ties together many of the key concepts covered in
      this section. When a customer initiates the checkout process, an order is
      created from the cart. The order is incomplete until after a successful
      payment is made. A complete order can be shipped and the product deducted
      from inventory counts.


      ![Checkout workflow](/assets/checkout-flow.png)


      ### Summary of the checkout workflow


      1. Add a product to a cart. A cart and its reference number is generated.

      2. Manage the cart items. For example, you might add items, remove items,
      and change quantities.

      3. Check out the cart. An incomplete order is created.

      4. Pay for an order: provide billing and shipping details, if you are a
      new customer. The order is now in the processing status.

      5. If using a manual gateway, after you authorize and capture it,
      Composable Commerce considers the order complete. If you use a third-party
      integration supported by Composable Commerce (such as Stripe), after the
      third-party gateway authorizes and captures the payment, the order becomes
      complete. Usually capture does not occur at the same time as
      authorization. For more information, see the Capture section.

      6. After the order is shipped, you can manually flag it as fulfilled.


      ### Carts


      When a product is added to a cart, a cart is generated together with its
      unique reference ID that on checkout becomes a part of the order ID. If
      you are using our JavaScript software development kit, generating a cart
      reference ID is done for you; otherwise, add a cart reference generator to
      your functionality.


      ### Promotions and custom items


      Optionally, apply a promotion code on a cart, or add custom_items to
      modify the product price (typically to handle taxes, customs, or
      shipping).


      ### Checkout


      You can checkout a cart with an associated customer name and email
      (customer object). Typically, this would be used for new customers or ones
      that prefer to shop as guests. Use the customer.id checkout option to
      checkout for an existing customer. After a successful checkout is
      completed, the response contains an order.


      Email addresses that either begin or end with a period, or contain
      consecutive periods, are considered invalid, resulting in the following
      error:

      ```json

      "errors": [
        {
            "status": 400,
            "source": "data.customer.email",
            "title": "format",
            "detail": "Does not match format 'email'"
        }
      ]
        ```

      ### Payments


      On checkout, an incomplete order is created. You can then use a
      third-party integration to handle your payment gateway. If the payment
      gateway is supported by Composable Commerce, such as Stripe, the payment
      is processed externally but handled internally. When a successful
      validation is returned, Composable Commerce flags the order as complete.


      If you are using a payment method not officially supported by Composable
      Commerce, the gateway needs to be implemented and handled manually. After
      the payment has been authorized and captured either through Commerce
      Manager or API, the status of an order becomes complete.


      ### Shipping


      The status of an order and the status of shipping are handled separately,
      and so an order can be complete but not shipped. Orders that have not been
      shipped yet have a status of unfulfilled. This flag is generated
      automatically by Composable Commerce when an order is created. Currently,
      you can only update the shipping status manually, through the API. After
      the order is shipped, flag its shipping status as fulfilled.


      ### Inventory


      If enabled, you can manage your stock. As such, your stock is
      automatically updated as soon as a product is checked out.
    x-displayName: Checkout
  - name: Orders
    description: >
      An Order is created through the [checkout](/docs/api/carts/checkout)
      endpoint within the Carts API.


      An order is created after a customer checks out their cart. On creation,
      the order is marked unpaid. The customer is prompted for a shipping
      address, a billing address, and a payment method. After the order is
      successfully paid, you can trigger an inventory process and a shipping
      process.


      You can keep a history of orders associated with the customer account.


      ### Reorder


      A re-order is when a shopper copies items from a previous order from their
      order history into a cart of their choice. If a shopper re-orders to an
      empty cart, the same quantities as the past order are applied. If the
      shopper re-orders to an existing cart, and orders the same item, the
      quantity increases. If an item is out of stock, the item is not added to
      the cart, and the shopper sees an insufficient stock error. The tax for
      the items in a re-order is not applied. For more information, see [Tax
      Items](/docs/api/carts/tax-items).
    x-displayName: Orders
  - name: Payments
    description: >
      When you [checkout](/docs/api/carts/checkout) a
      [cart](/docs/api/carts/cart-management), an unpaid
      [order](/docs/api/carts/orders) is returned. You can process the payment
      for the order though a payment gateway.


      :::note


      - You need to configure and enable a payment gateway before you can accept
      payments for orders.

      - Configure your store to use [Manual
      Gateway](/docs/api/payments/update-manual-gateway) to process payments if
      the order total is zero or the payment is through non-supported payment
      providers.

      - There are a number of actions that happen to your inventory when
      checking out and paying for an order. For more information, see
      [Inventory](/docs/api/pxm/inventory/inventories-introduction).

      - We recommend to wait until the payment confirmation process is fully
      completed before proceeding with any additional updates to the order.
      Making simultaneous updates to the same entity immediately after payment
      confirmation can lead to a race condition. To learn more information on
      handling parallel calls to API objects, see [Parallel Calls to API
      Objects](/guides/Getting-Started/api-contract#parallel-calls-to-api-objects).


      :::


      ### Payment Methods


      Depending on the chosen gateway, you may or may not have access to capture
      funds immediately or authorize for later payment. For more information,
      see [Transactions](/docs/api/carts/transactions).


      To make a partial payment in Postman through any payment gateway, specify
      the desired payment amount in the amount field within the request body. To
      learn about Split Payments, see the [Split
      Payments](/docs/api/payments/payment-gateways-introduction#split-payments)
      section.


      #### Purchase


      The simplest method is purchase. The gateway attempts to charge the
      customer immediately, and the result of the attempt is returned.


      You can partially pay funds using purchase method. The gateway attempts to
      charge the customer immediately, and the payment status for an order shows
      `partially_paid`.


      When you Get an order, you can see the following fields in the meta
      object:


      - `balance_owing`: Specifies the outstanding funds required to complete an
      order. It considers all complete or pending transactions, including
      authorized, paid, and captured transactions. (`balance_owing` = order
      total - `authorized` amount - `paid` amount).

      - `paid`: Specifies the total amount of purchased or captured
      transactions.

      - `authorized`: Specifies the total amount of completed or pending
      authorized transactions for an order.


      #### Authorize


      You can `authorize` a payment so funds can later be captured when an item
      is dispatched or restocked.


      You can partially pay for an order using `authorize` payment method so
      that the order is `partially_authorized`. The transaction must be complete
      for the order status to be `partially_authorized`.


      For more information about order and payment statuses for split payments,
      see [Split
      Payments](/docs/api/payments/payment-gateways-introduction#split-payments).


      #### Capture


      After authorizing a transaction, you have to capture the authorized funds.


      :::note


      We recommend capturing payments several hours to days after the
      authorization to mitigate risks of fraud and chargebacks. When you sell
      digital goods that are delivered immediately, we recommend using a single
      purchase call instead of separate authorize and capture calls.


      :::


      After the payment is `partially_authorized`, you must `capture` the
      authorized transaction later. Once you capture the authorized
      transactions, the order payment status will change to `partially_paid`.


      #### Refunds


      You can use either the Refund through Composable Commerce or use the Mark
      as Refunded capability, or a combination of both capabilities.


      For more information about refund for split payments, see [Refund a
      Payment](/docs/api/carts/refund-a-transaction).


      #### Refund through Composable Commerce


      You can start a full or partial refund to a supported payment provider
      directly from Commerce Manager or the API. When you start the refund
      process, the refund request is sent to the payment gateway. You no longer
      have to log on to your payment gateway’s console to process the refund.


      When you process a refund, use the refund endpoint to pass the refund
      amount. If you don’t pass an amount, the refund is processed as Mark as
      refunded. For more information, see the Mark as Refunded section.


      Each time a partial refund is triggered, the transaction.updated event is
      generated and updated with refunded.amount. The `order.updated` event is
      also triggered. The `order.refunded` event generates when the full amount
      is refunded.



      #### Mark as Refunded


      You can use your payment gateway’s console to process a refund. Process
      the refund first in the payment gateway and then use the **Mark as
      Refunded** capability in Composable Commerce to complete the process.


      When an order is **Marked as refunded**, the payment status
      `order.payment.status` is set to refunded. In this case, the
      `order.updated`, `transaction.updated` and `order.refunded` events are
      generated.

      With custom discounts, you can allow your shoppers to apply discounts from
      external services to their purchases. To apply custom discounts to carts
      and cart items, you need to set `custom_discounts_enabled` field to `true`
      in your [Cart Settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).


      You cannot add custom discounts to an empty cart.


      :::caution


      - You can apply up to five custom discounts to cart and cart item.

      - The stores that use [simple calculation
      method](/guides/How-To/Carts/calculate-totals) do not support custom
      discounts.

    x-displayName: Custom Discounts

    description: >
      Taxes differ by country and can differ within the country by region,
      state, or province. Each jurisdiction has a unique tax code and rate. If
      your store serves many jurisdictions, integrate a third-party tax
      generator to manage taxes. If your store serves a few jurisdictions, you
      can use the API to define the tax codes and rates in Composable Commerce.


      Taxes are calculated after all promotional discounts have been applied.
      When calculating taxes on a cart or order, you can choose from the
      following methods for calculating taxes:

        - Simple calculation method: Taxes are calculated at the unit level and are rounded to the nearest penny for the unit.
        - Line calculation method: Default. Taxes are calculated at the line level and are rounded to the nearest penny for the line.
          For more information about calculation methods, see [Calculate cart and order totals](/guides/How-To/Carts/calculate-totals).

      :::note

      Tax items can be added and removed using [client_credentials access
      tokens](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token). Only
      administrators with `client-credentials` access tokens are able to manage
      tax items.

      operationId: getByContextAllNodes
      summary: Get all Nodes
      description: >
        Returns all nodes in the catalog.


        If you have multiple catalog rules defined, the rule that best matches
        the shoppers context is used to determine which catalog is retrieved.
        For information about how rules are matched, see [Resolving Catalog
        Rules](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/rules#resolving-catalog-rules).


        You can see the parent nodes a node is associated with in the
        `bread_crumb` metadata for each node. This is useful if you want to
        improve how your shoppers search your store, for example. See [Product
        and Node Associations in Breadcrumb
        Metadata](/guides/How-To/Catalogs/breadcrumbs).


        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. For more information, see [Building
        breadcrumbs in a storefront](#building-breadcrumbs-in-a-storefront).


        The response lists the products associated with the nodes. If products
        are [curated](/guides/How-To/Products/curating-products), they are
        displayed in `curated_products`. Product curation allows you to promote
        specific products within each of your hierarchies, enabling you to
        create unique product collections in your storefront.


        - You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20
        curated products.

        - If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also
        removed from the `curated_products` list.


        ### Filtering


        This endpoint supports filtering. For general syntax, see
        [Filtering](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering). The following operators
        and attributes are available.


        | Operator  | Description | Attributes | Example |

        | --- | --- | --- | --- |

        | `Eq` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are,
        the condition is true. | `name`, `slug` | `filter=eq(name,some-name)` |

        | `in`      | Checks if the values are included in the specified string.
        If they are, the condition is true.

        | `Id` | 
        `filter=in(id,9214719b-17fe-4ea7-896c-d61e60fc0d05,e104d541-2c52-47fa-8a9a-c4382480d97c,65daaf68-ff2e-4632-8944-370de835967d)`

        ### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront


        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.


        `filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`


        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.

        The response lists the products associated with a node. If products are
        [curated](/guides/How-To/Products/curating-products), they are displayed
        in `curated_products`. Product curation allows you to promote specific
        products within each of your nodes, enabling you to create unique
        product collections in your storefront.


        - If you don't provide any `curated_products`, products are listed by
        their `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently
        updated product first.

        - If you configure `curated_products` for only a few products, the
        curated products are displayed first and the other products are
        displayed in the order of `updated_at` time.

        - You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20
        curated products.

      description: >
        For a specified product and catalog release, retrieves a list of child
        products from a parent product. Any product other than a base product
        results in a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. Only the products in a
        `live` status are retrieved.
         
        If you have multiple catalog rules defined, the rule that best matches
        the shopperʼs context is used to determine which catalog is retrieved.
        If no catalog rules are configured, the first catalog found is returned.
        For information about how rules are matched, see [Resolving Catalog
        Rules](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/rules#resolving-catalog-rules).
         
        You can see the parent nodes a product is associated within the
        `breadcrumbs` metadata for each product. For example, this is useful if
        you want to improve how your shoppers search your store. See [Product
        and Node Associations in Breadcrumb
        Metadata](/guides/How-To/Catalogs/breadcrumbs).
         
        ### Filtering
         
        This endpoint supports filtering. For general filtering syntax, see
        [Filtering](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering). The following operators
        and attributes are available when filtering on this endpoint.
         
        | Operator |
        Description                                                                                    
        | Supported Attributes                                     | Example |

        |:---|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:---
        |

        | `Eq` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are,
        the condition is true. For `product_types` and `tags`, you can only
        specify one. For example, `filter=eq(product_types,child)`.            |
        `name`, `sku`, `slug`, `manufacturer_part_num`, `upc_ean`,
        `product_types`, `tags` | `filter=eq(name,some-name)` |

        | `In` | Checks if the values are included in the specified string. If
        they are, the condition is true. For `product_types` and `tags`, you can
        specify more than one. For example,
        `filter=in(product_types,child,bundle)`. | `id`, `name`, `sku`, `slug`,
        `manufacturer_part_num`, `upc_ean`, `product_types`, `tags`          |
        `filter=in(id,some-id)` |
         
        ### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront
         
        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.
         
        `filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`
         
        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.
         
        ### Including Resources
         
        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,
        such as, files or main image, bundle component products and product
        attributes, such as SKU or slug. 
         
        | Parameter | Required |

        ### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront


        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.


        `filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`


        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.
         
        ### Including Resources

        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.


        ### Including Resources


        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,

      summary: Configure a Shopper Bundle
      description: >
        Once you have configured your product bundles, you can display them in
        your storefront in your published catalog. Depending on how you have
        configured the minimum and maximum values for the product options in
        your components, you can allow your shoppers to choose which products
        they want to select. For example, you can enable a shopper to select 1
        or more product options from a list of 10, giving your shoppers greater
        flexibility when selecting products in your store front.


        - Products must be in a `live` status.

        - If you have not specified any minimum or maximum values for the
        product options in your components, your shoppers can select any
        combination of product options.


        If you have configured minimum and maximum values using [Create a
        Bundle](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product), this becomes part of the
        `bundle_configuration`. You can check how your bundle is configured
        using [Get a product in a catalog
        release](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/get-product) in `bundle_configuration`
        under `meta`. The `bundle_configuration` forms the body of the request.


        The response updates the `bundle_configuration` with the product options
        the shopper selects. The `meta` data is updated with the `meta` data of
        the selected product options. In your storefront, you could display this
        as a summary of the product options a shopper has selected.


        ### Including Resources


        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,
        such as, files or main image, bundle component products and product

      summary: Creates a new catalog
      description: >
        Before you create a catalog, you must define the following resources:


        - Hierarchies - hierarchies and nodes to categorize the products.

        - Products - product information, associated assets, and links to
        hierarchy nodes.

        - Price Books - prices for the products associated with the hierarchies.
        You can create multiple price books for different scenarios, such as
        seasonal sales, business versus retail customer pricing, and reward
        programs. When creating a catalog, you can specify up to five price
        books. You must configure a priority for your price books. Product
        prices are displayed in the catalog according to the priority of the
        price books. Priority is a number and the price book with the highest
        number has the highest priority.

        Retrieves a list of all the catalogs that you are authorized to view.
        Currently, published catalogs are limited to the current release and two
        releases prior to the current release. You can see the differences
        between the last 2 consecutive catalog releases using the delta link
        returned in the response of a [publish a
        catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release) endpoint.
         
        You can use the `is_full_delta` attribute returned from the `get a
        release of a catalog` endpoint to determine if you need to refresh the
        data in your company system before publishing a catalog release and
        injecting fresh data in a delta link. The `is_full_delta` attribute
        tells you if this is a full publish of a catalog release. Using a search
        service as an example, if the `is_full_delta` attribute is `true`, you
        should remove all data about that catalog from the search service before
        publishing a catalog release and injecting fresh data from the delta
        file. See [Publish a catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release).


        If the `is_full_publish` attribute returned in the response is `false`,
        data from the previous catalog release overlaid the existing data in the
        delta file. The `is_full_publish` attribute is always `true` the first
        time a catalog is published.

      summary: Publishes a catalog
      description: >
        Publishes a catalog. You must publish a catalog before you can retrieve
        that catalog in an organization or store. The hierarchies, live
        products, and prices associated with a published catalog are in
        read-only mode. If you make a change to these resources, for example, a
        change to your price book or hierarchies, you need to republish the
        catalog.
         
        You can get [a catalog release](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/get-release-by-id)
        to retrieve a published catalog. Currently, published catalogs are
        limited to the current release and two releases prior to the current
        release.
         
        You can see the differences between the last 2 consecutive catalog
        releases. This is useful if want to understand how your products have
        changed in your catalog, ensuring your site search integration is kept
        up-to-date.
         
        Once a catalog release has completed publishing, the delta relationship
        links to the delta document.


        The `delta` links are signed and only valid for 1 hour. Re-reading a
        catalog release, for example, using [Getting a release of a
        catalog](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-latest-release/get-a-release-of-a-catalog)
        returns a fresh a link.
         
        You can use the `is_full_delta` attribute returned from the `get a
        release of a catalog` endpoint to determine if you need to refresh the
        data in your company system before injecting fresh data in a `delta`
        link. The `is_full_delta` attribute tells you if this is a full publish
        of the catalog. Using a search service as an example, if the
        `is_full_delta` attribute is `true`, you should remove all data about
        that catalog from the search service before injecting fresh data from
        the `delta` file. If the `is_full_delta` attribute is `false`, then data
        from the previous catalog overlays the existing data in the `delta`
        file. To publish a catalog and inject fresh data in a `delta` link, set
        `export_full_delta` to `true`.
         
        If a previous catalog publish date is greater than 90 days, then a full
        catalog publish is automatically performed. If you publish your catalogs
        infrequently, Commerce may perform a full publish when you are expecting
        a delta publish.
         
        :::caution


        Generating a full delta is resource intensive and slows down the
        publishing process and so should only be performed in certain
        circumstances, for example, when initializing an integration with a
        service like Algolia.
         
        :::
         
        The `is_full_delta` attribute is always `true` the first time a catalog
        is published. The information is stored in a collection of `json`
        documents in a compressed file. You can either manually check the file
        or, for example, use them to automatically update another company system
        you may have.
         
        - Delta files are only available for 30 days.

        - Delta files are removed when a catalog release is deleted.
         
        Each document has a `delta_type` with one of the following values,
        depending on whether a product has been deleted, updated or created in a
        catalog release.
         
        - `delete` describes products deleted from this release of a catalog.

        - `createupdate` describes products updated in this release of a
        catalog.
         
        ### Multi-Store Management Solutions
         
        In a multi-store management solution.
         
        - You can create organization catalogs. Your organization catalogs are
        available for your stores to use.

        - Your stores can create their own catalogs.

        - Your stores can create catalogs that have a combination of
        organization products and store products.
         
        If you are publishing a catalog in a store that contains resources from
        an organization, in Commerce Manager, you must enable the **Include
        Organization Resources in Catalog Publishes** checkbox.
         
        1. Go to **SYSTEM** > **Store Settings**.

        2. Click **General Settings**.

        3. Select **PXM** from the list.

        4. Select the **Include Organization Resources in Catalog Publishes**
        checkbox.

        If you have multiple catalogs, create catalog rule resources. With
        catalog rules, you can display different catalogs to different shoppers.
        For example, you can display a preferred pricing catalog to a few
        special customers. Or you can display one catalog to shoppers using your
        website and a different catalog to shoppers using your mobile app.
        Finally, you can define custom criteria by creating tags.


        :::note


        - If you have one catalog for all customers and channels, you can omit
        creating this resource.

        - Due to the way catalogs are cached in Commerce, using catalog rules to
        display catalogs sometimes causes a 5-minute time delay before the
        catalogs are displayed.

        - You cannot create catalog rules for organization catalogs.

        ### Filtering
         
        This endpoint supports filtering. For general syntax, see
        [Filtering](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering).


        | Operator | Description | Supported Attributes | Example |

        |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |

        | `Eq` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are,
        the condition is true. | `name`, `slug`| `filter=eq(name,some-name)` |

        ### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront


        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.


        `filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`


        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.

        You can see the parent nodes a node is associated with in the
        `bread_crumb` metadata for each node. This is useful if you want to
        improve how your shoppers search your store, for example. See [Product
        and Node Associations in Breadcrumb
        Metadata](/guides/How-To/Catalogs/breadcrumbs).


        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. See [Building breadcrumbs in a
        storefront](#building-breadcrumbs-in-a-storefront).


        The response lists the products associated with the nodes. If products
        are [curated](/guides/How-To/Products/curating-products), they are
        displayed in `curated_products`. Product curation allows you to promote
        specific products within each of your hierarchies, enabling you to
        create unique product collections in your storefront.


        - If you don't provide any `curated_products`, products are listed by
        their `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently
        updated product first.

        - If you configure `curated_products` for only a few products, the
        curated products are displayed first and the other products are
        displayed in the order of `updated_at` time.

        - You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20
        curated products.

        - If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also
        removed from the `curated_products` list.

        - A product that is curated has the `"curated_product": true` attribute
        displayed.

        ### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront


        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.


        `filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`


        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.

        You can see the parent nodes a product is associated with in the
        `bread_crumbs` and `bread_crumb_nodes` metadata for each product. This
        is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store,

        The `variations` object lists the variation IDs and variation option IDs
        and their corresponding product IDs that are generated when the
        variation and variation options are built with a product. The
        `variations` object can then be added to your catalogs. By default,
        variations and variation options are sorted randomly. You can use the
        `sort_order` attribute to sort the order of your variation and variation
        options in `variations`. Once a parent product is published in a
        catalog, the [Get a List of products in a catalog
        release](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/get-all-products) response displays the
        sorted variations and variation options. Variations and variation
        options are displayed in descending order according to their
        `sort_order` values.
         
        ### Including Resources


        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,
        such as, files or main image, bundle component products and product
        attributes, such as SKU or slug.

        ### Product and Node Associations in Breadcrumb Metadata


        You can see the parent nodes a product is associated with in the
        `bread_crumbs` and `bread_crumb_nodes` metadata for each product. This
        is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store,

        Metadata](/guides/How-To/Catalogs/breadcrumbs).


        ### Product Variations


        The `variations` object lists the variation IDs and variation option IDs
        and their corresponding product IDs that are generated when the
        variation and variation options are built with a product. The
        `variations` object can then be added to your catalogs. By default,
        variations and variation options are sorted randomly. You can use the
        `sort_order`attribute to sort the order of your variation and variation
        options in `variations`. Once a parent product is published in a
        catalog, the get a product in a catalog release response displays the
        sorted variations and variation options. Variations and variation
        options are displayed in descending order according to their
        `sort_order` values.


        ### Including Resources


        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,
        such as, files or main image, bundle component products and product
        attributes, such as SKU or slug.

      description: >
        With Product Experience Manager, you can
        [create](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product) and manage bundles. A
        bundle is a purchasable product, comprising of one or more products that
        you want to sell together. 


        You can create multiple components within a bundle. Each component must
        have at least one or more options. Each option is a product and a
        quantity.


        This endpoint returns a list of component product IDs for the specified
        bundle.


        ### Including Resources


        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,
        such as, files or main image, bundle component products and product
        attributes, such as SKU or slug. 


        | Parameter | Required |

      description: >
        For a specified product and catalog release, retrieves a list of child
        products from a parent product. Any product other than a base product
        results in a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. Only the products in a
        `live` status are retrieved.
         
        If you have multiple catalog rules defined, the rule that best matches
        the shoppers context is used to determine which catalog is retrieved. If
        no catalog rules are configured, the first catalog found is returned.
        For information about how rules are matched, see [Resolving Catalog
        Rules](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/rules#resolving-catalog-rules).
         
        You can see the parent nodes a product is associated within the
        breadcrumbs metadata for each product. For example, this is useful if
        you want to improve how your shoppers search your store. See [Product
        and Node Associations in Breadcrumb
        Metadata](/guides/How-To/Catalogs/breadcrumbs).
         
        ### Filtering
         
        This endpoint supports filtering. For general filtering syntax, see
        [Filtering](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering). The following operators
        and attributes are available when filtering on this endpoint.
         
        | Operator |
        Description                                                                                    
        | Supported Attributes                                     | Example |

        |:---|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:---
        |

        | `Eq` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are,
        the condition is true. For `product_types`, you can only specify one
        product type. For example, `filter=eq(product_types,child)`.           
        | `name`, `sku`, `slug`, `manufacturer_part_num`, `upc_ean`,
        `product_types`, `tags` | `filter=eq(name,some-name)` |

        | `In` | Checks if the values are included in the specified string. If
        they are, the condition is true. For `product_types`, you can specify
        more than one product type. For example,
        `filter=in(product_types,child,bundle)`. | `id`, `name`, `sku`, `slug`,
        `manufacturer_part_num`, `upc_ean`, `product_types`, `tags`          |
        `filter=in(id,some-id)` |
         
        ### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront
         
        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.
         
        `filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`
         
        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.
         
        ### Including Resources
         
        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,
        such as, files or main image, bundle component products and product
        attributes, such as SKU or slug. 
         
        | Parameter | Required |

        If you have multiple catalog rules defined, the rule that best matches
        the shoppers context is used to determine which catalog is retrieved.
        See [Resolving catalog
        rules](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/rules#resolving-catalog-rules).


        You can see the parent nodes a product is associated with in the
        `bread_crumbs` and `bread_crumb_nodes` metadata for each product. This
        is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store,
        for example. See [Product and Node Associations in Breadcrumb
        Metadata](/guides/How-To/Catalogs/breadcrumbs).


        The `variations` object lists the variation IDs and variation option IDs
        and their corresponding product IDs that are generated when the
        variation and variation options are built with a product. The variations
        object can then be added to your catalogs. By default, variations and
        variation options are sorted randomly. You can use the `sort_order`
        attribute to sort the order of your variation and variation options in
        variations. Once a parent product is published in a catalog, the [Get a
        List of products in a catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/get-all-products)
        release response displays the sorted variations and variation options.
        Variations and variation options are displayed in descending order
        according to their `sort_order` values.

        | `Eq` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are,
        the condition is true. For `product_types` and `tags`, you can only
        specify one. For example, `filter=eq(product_types,child)`.          |

        `product_types`, `tags` | `filter=eq(name,some-name)` |

        | `In` | Checks if the values are included in the specified string. If
        they are, the condition is true. For `product_types` and `tags`, you can
        specify more than one. For example,
        `filter=in(product_types,child,bundle)`. | `id`, `name`, `sku`, `slug`,
        `manufacturer_part_num`, `upc_ean`, `product_types`, `tags`          |

        ### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront
         
        In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a
        hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build
        breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.
         
        `filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`
         
        - Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.

        - You can have as many node Ids as you want.

        - It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are
        returned in the order they were last updated.
         
        ### Including Resources
         
        Using the `include` parameter, you can retrieve top-level resources,
        such as, files or main image, bundle component products and product
        attributes, such as SKU or slug.

      description: >

        Creates a cart. Call this endpoint each time a customer creates a cart.


        Each shopper can have multiple carts. Use the carts API to create a
        cart. The carts are distinct from one another. Shoppers can add
        different items to their carts. They can check out one of the carts
        without affecting the content or status of their other carts.


        After the shopper checks out the cart, the cart remains available to the
        shopper. The cart is persistent and stays with the shopper after it is
        used.


        You can also create a cart to specify custom discounts. You can enable
        custom discounts when the `discount_settings.custom_discounts_enabled`
        field is set to `true`. Default is set from cart discount settings for
        the store. See [Update Cart
        Settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).


        ### Preview Cart


        You can set a future date for your shopping cart and view the promotions
        that will be available during that time period. This feature enables you
        to validate your promotion settings and observe how they will be applied
        in the cart.


        :::caution

        - Once the cart is in preview mode, you cannot revert it to a regular
        cart.

        - Carts with `snapshot_date` are same as preview carts.

        - You cannot checkout a cart that includes a `snapshot_date`.

        - To delete a promotion preview cart, use [Delete a
        cart](/docs/api/carts/delete-a-cart) endpoint.

        - The promotion preview cart has the same expiration time as a regular
        cart based on the store's [cart
        settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).

        - Preview cart interactions skip inventory checks and events, allowing
        users to preview future carts without impacting related external
        systems.

        :::


        ### Custom Attributes

        You can create custom attributes for the cart object to include
        additional information, enabling promotions that target specific cart
        attributes.

        For example:

        ```

        "custom_attributes":{
          "membership": {
            "type": "string",
            "value": "VIP"
          }
        }

        ```

        See [adding cart custom attributes in promotions
        builder](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#adding-cart-custom-attributes)


        Cart custom attributes remain with the corresponding cart for the extent
        of its lifecycle.  These custom attributes carry over to the resulting
        order objects on checkout and those on carts are deleted with their
        carts upon cart deletions.

        Custom attributes can be updated or removed using a PUT request. To
        delete specific custom attributes, simply exclude the unwanted attribute
        objects from the PUT request body.


        ### Contact Email

        You can attach an email to carts via the `contact.email` field.  These
        values help identify guest shopper carts and, in the case of promotions
        with maximum usage settings for guest and registered shopper, track
        per-shopper promotion usages.

        See [Create Max Uses Per Shopper Promotion
        Codes](/docs/promotions-builder/promotions-builder-codes/create-max-use-limit-promotion-codes)


        For example:

        ```

        "contact": {
          "email": "tester@email.com"
        }

        ```


        Please note, this value is not supported for registered shopper carts
        (that is, carts with accounts or customers associated), as these carts
        already have email values associated via the shopper details. 
        Accordingly, requests to add contact email information to registered
        shopper carts (and vice versa) result in error messages.


        ### Errors


        - `400 Bad Request` : This is returned when the submitted request does
        not adhere to the expected API contract for the endpoint.

           - For example, in the case of string fields, this error might indicate issues in the length or format of submitted strings. For more information about valid string fields, refer to Safe Characters section.
           - In the case of preview carts (those with `snapshot_date`), an error is returned for invalid actions, such as removing the preview date, setting a preview date in the past, or attempting to checkout a cart with a `snapshot_date`.

        groups, calling this endpoint displays the associated shipping group IDs
        in the relationships section.


        :::note


        - The default cart name is Cart. However, you can update the cart name
        as required. Ensure that the string length of the name is greater than
        or equal to one. Follow the safe character guidelines for name and
        description naming. For more information about cart ID naming
        requirements, see the [Safe

        - Outside of the JS-SDK, we don't handle creating cart references. You
        need to create your own.

      summary: Get Cart Items
      description: >

        Use this endpoint to retrieve cart items. If the cart is associated with
        shipping groups, calling this endpoint displays the associated shipping
        group IDs.


        You can use this endpoint to retrieve the breakdown of cart items by
        promotion ID. For example, if you have Promotions Standard item discount
        with code *sale2024*, Rule Promotions item discount with code
        *sale2024*, and Rule Promotions cart discount with code *sale2024*, the
        `discounts.constituents` field in the response example will show the
        breakdown of the same promotion code used in both Promotions Standard
        and Rule Promotions.

        The bulk update feature allows shoppers to update an array of items to
        their cart in one action, rather than updating each item one at a time.
        Shoppers can update quantity and shipping group details in bulk
        requests. This minimizes the time for shoppers while updating items to
        their cart. Shoppers can even update multiple items with the same or
        different shipping groups to their cart.


        When you update multiple items that qualify for free gifts in the cart,
        the corresponding free gifts for all eligible products are also
        automatically updated in the cart.

        ### Add Product to Cart


        Adding a Product to Cart is the most common Cart action. If you want to
        add any custom products or promotions, you need to do that as a separate
        action.


        #### Dynamic Bundles


        A bundle is a purchasable product that is composed of a combination of
        two or more products that you want to sell together. You can create
        multiple components within a bundle. Each component can have one or more
        options. Each option is a product and a quantity. You can configure
        minimum and/or maximum values for the number of product options in a
        component that your shoppers can select. For example, you can enable a
        shopper to select 1 or more product options from a list of 10. These are
        called [dynamic
        bundles](/docs/api/pxm/products/products#dynamic-bundles).


        Your dynamic bundles are displayed in your published catalogs.


        1. Use the configure a shopper endpoint to allow shoppers to make their
        selections from a bundle.

        2. In the response of the configure a shopper, the
        `bundle_configuration` object contains the bundle selections a shopper
        has made.

        3. In the add a product to cart request, use the `bundle_configuration`
        object to add the customers selections to a cart.


        ```json
          "bundle_configuration": {
               "selected_options": {
                   "games": {
                       "d7b79eb8-19d8-45ea-86ed-2324a604dd9c": 1
                   },
                   "toys": {
                       "0192ccdd-6d33-4898-87d7-c4d87f2bf8ea": 1,
                       "1aea6f97-f0d9-452c-b3c1-7fb5629ead82": 1
                   }
               }
        }

        ```


        When a cart is checked out, the options a shopper selected are added to
        the order. See [order items](/docs/api/carts/get-order-items).


        #### Personalized Products


        You can allow shoppers to personalize their goods by adding custom text
        inputs to products directly. This feature is particularly useful for
        customizable items, such as personalized T-shirts or greeting cards. You
        can use this functionality by leveraging the `custom_inputs` attribute,
        and defining the details and validation rules for the custom text.


        First, you must configure a `custom_inputs` attribute when creating a
        new product or updating an existing product. Once you have defined your
        custom inputs on a product, you must configure the custom inputs in your
        orders.


        For example, you may sell T-shirts that can have personalized text on
        the front and back of the shirt.


        ```json
            {
              "data": {
                "type": "product",
                  "attributes": {
                      "custom_inputs": {
                          "front": {
                              "name": "T-Shirt Front",
                              "validation_rules": [
                              {
                                  "type": "string",
                                  "options": {
                                  "max_length": 50
                              }
                          }
                      ],
                            "required": false
                },
                          "back": {
                            "name": "T-Shirt Back",
                            "validation_rules": [
                        {
                              "type": "string",
                              "options": {
                              "max_length": 50
                    }
                  }
                ],
                           "required": false
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }

        ```


        If the same product has different `custom_inputs` attributes, then these
        are added as separate items in a cart.


        The `custom_inputs` attribute is stored in the cart item and the text
        for `custom_input` must not exceed 255 characters in length. When a cart
        is checked out, the `custom_inputs` attribute becomes part of the order.


        #### Limitations on Usage of `custom_inputs` with Specific Promotion
        Types


        When you add products to a cart with `custom_inputs`, there are certain
        limitations on usage of the `custom_inputs` with the following promotion
        types:

          - For [Free Gift Promotions](/docs/api/promotions/create-a-promotion), you can add `custom_inputs` to gift items.
          - For [Fixed Bundle Discount Promotions](/docs/api/promotions/create-a-promotion), the promotion applies as long as the cart contains the bundle SKUs even when there are different `custom_inputs`.
          - For [X for Y Discount Promotion and X for amount discount promotion](/docs/api/promotions/create-a-promotion), the promotion applies when there are two SKUs with the same `custom_inputs`. The promotion does not apply when there are different `custom_inputs` and the SKUs are in different line items.

        #### Stock locations


        When adding to a cart it is possible to specify which [stock
        location](/docs/api/pxm/inventory_mli/inventories-introduction?#multi-location-inventories)
        should be used for tracking inventory for that product by specifying its
        slug in `location`. This might represent the warehouse a product is
        shipped from or the store holding the stock in a Buy Online Pick Up In
        Store scenario.


        Each line item is restricted to a single stock location. If the same
        product is added with a different location then the most
        recently-specified location will be used for the total quantity of that
        line item.


        :::note


        - Any requests to add a product to cart returns the collection of cart
        items.

        - [Tax items](/docs/api/carts/tax-items) may optionally be added with
        the product. Only administrators with [client_credentials access
        tokens](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token) are able to do
        this. If included, they replace any existing taxes on the product.

        - The cart currency is set when the first item is added to the cart.

        - The product being added to the cart requires a price in the same
        currency as the other items in the cart. The API returns a 400 error if
        a price is not defined in the correct currency.

        - A cart can contain a maximum of 100 unique items. Items include
        products, custom items, tax items, and promotions.

        - There are a number of actions that happen to your inventory when
        checking out and paying for an order. For more information, see the
        [Inventory](/docs/api/pxm/inventory/inventories-introduction)
        documentation.

        ### Including Resources


        When you make an `Add Product to Cart` request to the catalog-view
        service, you can obtain details of the component products. If you
        include the optional parameter `include=component_products` in the
        request, the response will include details for each component product.


        When a bundle with selected component products is added to a cart, the
        cart displays both the bundle pricing and component product IDs.


        The response example is returned with a new field called
        `component_products` under `bundle_configuration`, which is a list of
        component products that the user has selected for dynamic bundles.


        | Parameter               | Required     | Description        |

        |:------------------------|:-------------|:-------------------|

        | `component_products`    | Optional     | The component product data
        and key attribute data, such as SKU or slug, to return for component
        products in a product bundle. |

        | `main_image`            | Optional     | The main images associated
        with a product. |

        | `files`                 | Optional     | Any files associated with a
        product. |

            ]
        }

        ```


        See [Including
        Resources](https://elasticpath.dev/guides/Getting-Started/includes).


        ### Add Subscription to Cart


        To add a subscription to your cart, you need to provide the ID of the
        subscription offering and the ID of the plan within that offering that
        you want to subscribe to.


        ```json
          {
            {
              "data": {
                "id": "5b9be99f-1c94-4ddd-9718-81adab0cc3e0",
                "type": "subscription_item",
                "quantity": 1,
                "subscription_configuration": {
                  "plan": "40010dde-2f38-489b-8b3f-14a13cbfb431"
                }
            }
          }
        ```


        The price of the subscription item in the cart reflects the cost of the
        subscription's initial billing period. Once the cart has been checked
        out and the order paid for, the subscription will be automatically
        created in the subscriptions service.


        ### Add Custom Item to Cart


        You can add a custom item to the cart when you don't manage things like
        shipping, taxes and inventory in Commerce.


        For [Shipping Groups](/docs/ship-groups/shipping-groups/index), once you
        have created a [cart shipping
        group](/docs/ship-groups/shipping-groups/shipping-groups-api/create-cart-shipping-group),
        you need to link it to the cart items. This is important, because it is
        necessary to associate items with shipping groups in order to include
        shipping groups in the corresponding cart, order, and totals.


        :::note


        - Custom Cart Items are available when using [implicit access
        tokens](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token). Ensure that
        you always check each order has the correct details for each item, most
        importantly, price.


        :::


        ### Add Promotion to Cart


        You can use the Promotions API to apply discounts to your cart as a
        special cart item type. Any requests to add a product to cart will
        return a collection of cart items.

         There are certain limitations on usage of the `custom_inputs` attribute with some promotion types. See [Limitations on Usage of `custom_inputs` with Specific Promotion Types](/docs/api/carts/manage-carts#limitations-on-usage-of-custom_inputs-with-specific-promotion-types).

        To remove promotion from the cart via the promotion code, see [Delete
        Promotion Code from
        Cart](/docs/api/carts/delete-a-promotion-via-promotion-code).


        ### Re-order


        From a shopper’s order history, they can add the items from a previous
        order into their carts. Shoppers can add items regardless of past order
        status, such as incomplete or not paid. For more information, see
        [Orders](/docs/api/carts/orders).

          - Any requests to add an item to cart return a collection of [cart items](/docs/api/carts/cart-items).
          - A cart can contain a maximum of 100 unique items. Items include products, custom items, and promotions.
          - When a shopper creates a cart and re-orders items from an order with properties such as custom attributes, custom discounts, and payment intent ID, these properties will remain unchanged in the original cart.
          - Custom items do not exist in catalogs, and therefore cannot be reordered.

        ### Merging Carts


        A shopper can have multiple carts, and the system may automatically
        merge items from an anonymous cart into the shopper's registered cart
        when they sign in. For example, if a shopper has an existing cart with
        items `A`, `B` and `C`, and later adds items `D` and `E` while not
        signed in, the system can merge these carts when the shopper signs in.
        After the carts merge, the cart contains items `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and
        `E`.


        If any items are duplicated from the anonymous cart to the registered
        cart, their quantities are incremented accordingly. For example, if a
        shopper's existing cart with items `A`, `B` and `C`, and they later add
        two more `A` items and one `B` item while not signed in, the system will
        merge the carts when the shopper signs in. The existing cart will now
        contain three `A` items, two `B` items, and one `C` item.


        :::note


        When the system merges items from one cart into another cart, properties
        such as custom attributes, custom discounts, and payment intent ID will
        remain unchanged in the original cart.

        ### Best Practices


        We recommend to include a unique `sku` code within the request body
        while adding custom items to carts. If the same `sku` is used for
        multiple products, they are merged into a single line item.


        For example, if a cart consists of the following items:


        - `product-1` with quantity 1 and sku code as `sku-1`

        - `product-2` with quantity 1 and sku code as `sku-1`

        - `product-3` with quantity 1 and sku code as `sku-2`.


        The following response is returned where it combines all products with
        the same sku codes into a single line item, while products with a unique
        sku codes are represented as separate items:

      summary: Bulk Add Tax Items to Cart
      description: >
        :::note


        A cart item can only have a maximum of five tax items.


        :::


        ### Errors


        `422 Unprocessable Entity`


        In this example, when `options.add_all_or_nothing` is set to `true` and
        if one of cart items is not found or has reached its maximum tax item
        limit, the following error response is returned:


        ```json

        {
                    "status": 422,
                    "title": "Add all or nothing.",
                    "detail": "Add all or nothing set to (true). Could not bulk add tax items to cart."
                }

        ```


        In this example, if you add more than five tax items to the same cart
        item, the following error response is returned:


        ```json

        {
                    "status": 422,
                    "title": "Tax item not added to cart item.",
                    "detail": "Cannot exceed tax item limit of (5) on cart item.",
                    "meta": {
                        "id": "f88e6370-cb35-40b2-a998-c759f31dec0a"
                    }
                }
        ```


        `404`


        In this example, if there is a mismatch between
        `cart_item`/`custom_item` and the `relationships.item.data.type`
        specified in the bulk add tax item, the following error response is
        returned:


        ```json

      summary: Create Stripe Payment Intent for a Cart
      description: >
        The Cart Payment Intent feature enables the creation of a Stripe Payment
        Intent specifically tied to a shopping cart and its subsequent order.
        This allows Payment Intent users to track payment details from the cart
        stage and seamlessly maintain consistency in payment information
        throughout the order stage. Using these features, you can create Payment
        Intents for their carts, update Payment Intents with final cart details,
        and synchronize Payment Intents from Stripe to Commerce.


        :::note


        - Typically, in Commerce, inventory is allocated at the time of payment
        initiation after an order is created. However, in the case of Cart
        Payment Intent, information about the payment is received only upon
        synchronizing the order from Stripe to Commerce. This may happen after
        the payment is completed. Therefore, there might be a delay between the
        payment made and allocation, increasing the chance of paying for items
        that are not in stock.

        - There are certain fields you can choose to set up when [creating a
        payment intent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/create).
        However, if you decide to update a payment intent, the available options
        may not be the same as those allowed while creating a payment intent.
        See [updating a payment
        intent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/update).


        :::


        The following steps outline the workflow associated with the Payment
        Intent:


        1. [Add items to
        cart](/docs/api/carts/manage-carts#add-custom-item-to-cart).

        1. [Create a Payment Intent for the
        cart](/docs/api/carts/create-cart-payment-intent). The Payment Intent is
        created in Stripe, reflecting the cart and transaction details,
        including currency, amounts, payment type, and any optional Stripe
        details. The Payment Intent ID is generated and linked to the cart.

        1. [Update a Payment
        Intent](/docs/carts-orders/update-cart-payment-intent). This step is
        optional but becomes necessary when there are changes in the cart
        details at the time of payment. It ensures the Payment Intent accurately
        reflects the current cart details when processing the payments on the
        front end.

        1. [Checkout the cart](/docs/api/carts/checkout). An unpaid order is
        created, and the Payment Intent ID is linked to the order.

        1. [Confirm the order](/docs/carts-orders/confirm-an-order). This is
        important because after checkout, it is essential to confirm the Payment
        Intent and synchronize it with Commerce. This results in a corresponding
        transaction and change in order statuses in Commerce. Additionally, the
        Payment Intent ID is removed from the order once it is linked via the
        transaction.


        ### Best Practices


        We recommend you follow these practices to maintain consistency and
        accuracy when using Cart Payment Intent.


        - After checkout, we recommend clearing the shopping cart. You can
        achieve this using a [Delete a cart](/docs/api/carts/delete-a-cart)
        endpoint or [Update a cart](/docs/api/carts/update-a-cart) to remove the
        Payment Intent ID. This helps to avoid potential issues where subsequent
        checkouts for the same cart might unintentionally use the previous
        Stripe Payment Intent ID.

        - If it is not reasonable to clear the cart immediately after checkout
        due to several subsequent, duplicate checkouts to the same cart, ensure
        that you only synchronize the Payment Intent when finalizing the order.
        Each order confirmation is unaware of the others, and syncing Payment
        Intent IDs for each confirmation can lead to duplicate transactions in
        Commerce. In other words, if you synchronize Payment Intents for earlier
        versions of a repeated checkout, you'll end up with multiple orders from
        the same cart, each having transactions linked to the same Payment
        Intent.

        - To pay the entire amount at once, use the [Update Cart Payment
        Intent](/docs/carts-orders/update-cart-payment-intent) endpoint to
        update the Stripe Payment Intent with the final cart details when
        preparing to take the payment. Doing so, ensures that the Payment Intent
        accurately reflects the current cart details when processing payments on
        the front end. We do not recommend calling the [Update Cart Payment
        Intent](/docs/carts-orders/update-cart-payment-intent) for each
        individual change in the cart, as this can lead to more requests and may
        slow down the front-end performance.

      description: >
        When a Cart is ready for checkout, you can convert the cart to an order.
        The cart remains and can be modified and checked out again if required.


        A cart can be checked out with a customer ID, customer object, or with
        an account by authenticating with the `Client Credentials Token`.


        After a successful checkout, a response that contains the order is
        returned. If the cart is linked to a shipping group, the shipping group
        is also associated with the order after checkout.


        You can checkout using one of the following methods:

        - **Customer ID**: You can checkout a cart with an existing customer ID.

        - **Guest Checkout** (Checkout with Customer Object): You can checkout a
        cart with an associated customer name and email.

        - **Checkout with Account**: The shopper authenticates with the `Client
        Credentials` Token.

        - **Checkout with Account Management Authentication Token**: The shopper
        authenticates with the `Implicit Token` and the
        `EP-Account-Management-Authentication-Token`.


        :::note


        - The cart currency is set when the first item is added to the cart.

        - The product being added to the cart requires a price in the same
        currency as the other items in the cart. The API returns a 400 error if
        a price is not defined in the correct currency.

        - To ensure that a free gift is automatically applied to an order, set
        the promotion to automatic. The checkout process will not be successful
        if free gift items are out of stock. See [Errors](#errors) section.


        :::


        :::caution


        - By default, carts are automatically deleted 7 days after the last
        update. You can change this setting by [updating cart
        settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).

        - Your inventory is modified during checkout and payment of an order.
        For more information about the changes in the inventory, see the
        [Inventory](/docs/api/pxm/inventory/inventories-introduction) section.


        :::

         You can pass `order_number` and `external_ref` in the checkout endpoint or when [updating an order](/docs/api/carts/update-an-order). The `order_number` is an optional, user-managed field that is used as an alternative to `order_id`. When processing transactions through Authorize.net, the `order_number` is sent instead of the `order_id`, and it will appear in the invoice number section. If no `order_number` is provided, the `order_id` is sent to Authorize.net on payment by default. There are no duplication restrictions on the `order_number` value.

        ### Next Steps


        After a cart has been converted to an Order using either of the previous
        methods, you most likely want to capture payment for order. See [Paying
        for an Order](/docs/api/carts/payments).


        ### Errors


        The following error response is returned during checkout when an
        eligible item is added to the cart, and the free gift is out of stock.

        This endpoint returns all orders with custom flow fields. The pagination
        offset is set to fetch a maximum of 10,000 orders. If the store has
        10,000 orders and you fetch the orders without using filters, an error
        is returned. Use a filter to view orders when the order is beyond the
        10,000 mark.


        :::note


        - Pass the `X-Moltin-Customer-Token` header to limit orders to a
        specific customer. See [Customer
        Tokens](/docs/customer-management/customer-management-api/customer-tokens).

        - Pass the `EP-Account-Management-Authentication-Token` header to limit
        orders to a specific account. See [Account Management
        Token](/docs/api/accounts/post-v-2-account-members-tokens).

      description: >
        You can only update custom data, `shipping`, `shipping_address`, and
        status of orders. All other settings in the order object are immutable.

         This endpoint allows you to:

        - **Update an order number and external reference**: You can update an
        existing order that does not have an `order_number` and `external_ref`,
        modify the `order_number` and `external_ref` values, or remove them by
        passing an empty value in the `order_number` and `external_ref` fields.

        - **Cancel an order**: You can cancel an order only if it has not been
        fulfilled.

        - **Fulfill an order**: You can fulfill a paid order only.


        :::caution


        You can update `shipping`, `shipping_address`, and status of an order
        only if the order is not fulfilled. You can use the refund API to refund
        an order only if the payment status is `paid`. Canceling an order does
        not automatically refund a payment. You must refund the orders manually.

      summary: Payment Setup
      description: >
        Depending on the payment gateway, you may have access to different
        transaction types such as capturing funds immediately or authorizing
        them for later. For more information, see
        [Transactions](/docs/api/carts/transactions).


        The following types of payment methods are available depending on the
        payment gateway:


        - `purchase`: This is the simplest method. The gateway attempts to
        charge the customer immediately.

        - `authorize`: This method authorizes a payment so that funds can be
        captured later, for example, when an item is dispatched or restocked.

        - `purchase_setup`: This method prepares the system for a purchase by
        verifying payment details without actually charging the customer. For
        example, a customer adds items to their cart and proceeds to checkout.
        Before finalizing the purchase, the system runs `purchase_setup` to
        confirm all payment details, but no funds are transferred until the
        customer confirms the order.

        - `authorize_setup`: This method prepares the system for an
        authorization-only transaction. This process holds the necessary funds
        but does not transfer them, ensuring that the customer has sufficient
        balance for the transaction. It sets up the conditions for a future
        capture of the authorized funds. For example, a customer places a
        pre-order for a product that will ship in two weeks. The merchant uses
        `authorize_setup` to prepare for the payment authorization. This holds
        the customer's funds to ensure they can cover the purchase but waits to
        capture the payment until the product ships. This ensures that payment
        is secured but not collected prematurely.


        :::note


        Split payments can be performed using any methods for any gateway.


        - You can partially pay funds using `purchase` method. The gateway
        attempts to charge the customer immediately, and the payment status for
        an order will show `partially_paid`

        - You can partially pay for an order using `authorize` method where the
        order will be marked as `partially_authorized`. The transaction must be
        completed for the order status to be `partially_authorized`.

        - A `purchase_setup` method allows verification of payment details for
        partial payments without transferring funds until the customer confirms
        the full order.

        - An `authorize_setup` method can be used to hold a partial amount of
        the total funds, ensuring the customer has enough balance for a future
        capture.

        Until a payment is made neither `purchase_setup` nor `authorize_setup`
        affects the payment statuses, and the order remains unpaid. For more
        information about order and payment statuses for split payments, see
        [Split
        payments](/docs/api/payments/payment-gateways-introduction#split-payments).

        Confirm Payment serves as a mechanism to synchronize transaction

        ### Handling 3D Secure Validations for Stripe Payments


        For Stripe Payments requiring 3D Secure validation, the transaction
        response will include the `client_parameters` object, which provides
        credentials to support validation of these payment requests on the
        payment provider's side. We recommend using the Stripe's client
        libraries to manage these 3D Secure validations. Once the validation
        succeeds, proceed with a confirmation request to sync the validated
        transaction into Composable Commerce and continue with the payment
        process.

      description: >
        There are two ways to refund; through your payment gateway and mark it
        refunded in Commerce Manager, or directly through Commerce Manager or
        API.


        * Mark as Refunded: You can manually mark a transaction as refunded.
        Before you can mark the order as refunded, you need to handle the actual
        refund on your side with your payment provider. Mark as Refunded is a
        full refund made to the transaction.

        * Refund through Composable Commerce: You can process a full or partial
        refund to a supported payment provider directly from Commerce Manager or
        API by providing the refund amount. When you start the refund process,
        the request is directly sent to the payment gateway.


        :::caution


        If you use manual gateway for partial or full refund, you need to handle
        the actual refund on your side with your payment provider.

        Product tags are used to store or assign a key word against a product.
        The product tag can then be used to describe or label that product.
        Using product tags means that you can group your products together, for
        example, by brand, category, subcategory, colors, types, industries, and
        so on. You can enhance your product list using tags, enabling you to
        refine your product list and run targeted promotions. Tags are used to
        refine the eligibility criteria for a rule. Requests populate the
        catalog rule tag using the `EP-Context-Tag` header.

             - **standard** - Standard products are a standalone products.
             - **parent** - A parent product is a product that has child products that have been built using the `Build Child Products` endpoint.

                    The schedules attribute must include the following.


                    - `valid_from` matches the date and time that the catalog is

                    You can offset the timezone by adding the offset to the end
