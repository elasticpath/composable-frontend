  title: Carts, Checkout, Orders Introduction
  description: |
    A cart contains a list of the products that a shopper adds to the cart while browsing your catalog. In the context of a cart, a selected product is called a cart item.

    A cart item identifies the product, the product price, the quantity selected, and the total price for the quantity selected. The cart displays a running total of the cost for the selected products plus the calculated tax.

    You can allow your shoppers to add custom text to a product when adding an item to their carts. This is useful, for example, if you have a product like a T-shirt that can be personalized. See [Add product to cart](/docs/api/carts/manage-carts#add-product-to-cart).

    After a shopper checks out, the cart is converted to an order, and you can manually delete the cart. If you don't delete the cart, it is purged automatically after seven days.

    The preview cart feature allows you to set a future date for your shopping cart and view the promotions that will be available during that time period. This feature enables you to validate your promotion settings and observe how they will be applied in the cart. See [Create a Preview Cart](/docs/api/carts/create-a-cart#preview-cart).

    The following diagram shows a typical cart workflow:

    ![Shows a cart workflow, starting from adding the first item to a cart, through cart creation and checkout](/assets/cart-workflow.png)

    ### Multiple Carts

    Buyers often make purchases based on jobs that they need to perform or outcomes they need to achieve and therefore require more than one shopping cart. For example, a corporate buyer places orders for multiple locations. Each location has a different frequency of ordering and require different products. The buyer can create one cart per location, fill the carts, and then check out the carts quickly. Similarly, shoppers can also create multiple carts for the ease of managing various shopping experiences, such as birthdays or holidays.

    Each cart is discrete and separate. Any updates or changes to one cart has no effect on the other carts. A cart persists, that is, it stays with the buyer or shopper even after they use the cart in a checkout. Carts remain available after a checkout.

        You can retrieve the carts that are associated with an [account](/docs/api/carts/account-cart-associations) or a [customer](/docs/api/carts/customer-cart-associations).

        When a shopper retrieves their latest carts, the carts are sorted in descending order by the updated_date. For more information, see [Pagination](/guides/Getting-Started/pagination).

      summary: Create a Cart
      description: |

        Creates a cart. Call this endpoint each time a customer creates a cart.

        Each shopper can have multiple carts. Use the carts API to create a cart. The carts are distinct from one another. Shoppers can add different items to their carts. They can check out one of the carts without affecting the content or status of their other carts.

        After the shopper checks out the cart, the cart remains available to the shopper. The cart is persistent and stays with the shopper after it is used.

        You can also create a cart to specify custom discounts. You can enable custom discounts when the `discount_settings.custom_discounts_enabled` field is set to `true`. Default is set from cart discount settings for the store. See [Update Cart Settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).

        ### Preview Cart

        You can set a future date for your shopping cart and view the promotions that will be available during that time period. This feature enables you to validate your promotion settings and observe how they will be applied in the cart.

        :::caution
        - Once the cart is in preview mode, you cannot revert it to a regular cart.
        - Carts with `snapshot_date` are same as preview carts.
        - You cannot checkout a cart that includes a `snapshot_date`.
        - To delete a promotion preview cart, use [Delete a cart](/docs/api/carts/delete-a-cart) endpoint.
        - The promotion preview cart has the same expiration time as a regular cart based on the store's [cart settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).
        - Preview cart interactions skip inventory checks and events, allowing users to preview future carts without impacting related external systems.
        :::

        ### Custom Attributes
        You can create custom attributes for the cart object to include additional information, enabling promotions that target specific cart attributes.
        For example:
        ```
        "custom_attributes":{
          "membership": {
            "type": "string",
            "value": "VIP"
          }
        }
        ```
        See [adding cart custom attributes in promotions builder](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder#adding-cart-custom-attributes)

        Cart custom attributes remain with the corresponding cart for the extent of its lifecycle.  These custom attributes carry over to the resulting order objects on checkout and those on carts are deleted with their carts upon cart deletions.
        Custom attributes can be updated or removed using a PUT request. To delete specific custom attributes, simply exclude the unwanted attribute objects from the PUT request body.

        ### Contact Email
        You can attach an email to carts via the `contact.email` field.  These values help identify guest shopper carts and, in the case of promotions with maximum usage settings for guest and registered shopper, track per-shopper promotion usages.
        See [Create Max Uses Per Shopper Promotion Codes](/docs/promotions-builder/promotions-builder-codes/create-max-use-limit-promotion-codes)

        For example:
        ```
        "contact": {
          "email": "tester@email.com"
        }
        ```

        Please note, this value is not supported for registered shopper carts (that is, carts with accounts or customers associated), as these carts already have email values associated via the shopper details.  Accordingly, requests to add contact email information to registered shopper carts (and vice versa) result in error messages.

        ### Errors

        - `400 Bad Request` : This is returned when the submitted request does not adhere to the expected API contract for the endpoint.

           - For example, in the case of string fields, this error might indicate issues in the length or format of submitted strings. For more information about valid string fields, refer to Safe Characters section.
           - In the case of preview carts (those with `snapshot_date`), an error is returned for invalid actions, such as removing the preview date, setting a preview date in the past, or attempting to checkout a cart with a `snapshot_date`.

        You can easily get a new or existing cart by providing the unique cart reference in the request. If the cart is associated with shipping groups, calling this endpoint displays the associated shipping group IDs in the relationships section.

        :::note

        - The default cart name is Cart. However, you can update the cart name as required. Ensure that the string length of the name is greater than or equal to one. Follow the safe character guidelines for name and description naming. For more information about cart ID naming requirements, see the [Safe Characters](/guides/Getting-Started/safe-characters) section.
        - Outside of the JS-SDK, we don't handle creating cart references. You need to create your own.

        :::

        :::caution

        An empty cart is returned for any carts that don’t currently exist. For more information about the cart items object, see [Get Cart Items](/docs/api/carts/get-cart-items).

For example, if you have Promotions Standard item discount with code *sale2024*, Rule Promotions item discount with code *sale2024*, and Rule Promotions cart discount with code *sale2024*, the `discounts.constituents` field in the response example will show the breakdown of the same promotion code used in both Promotions Standard and Rule Promotions.

      summary: Bulk Update Items in Cart
      description: |
        The bulk update feature allows shoppers to update an array of items to their cart in one action, rather than updating each item one at a time. Shoppers can update quantity and shipping group details in bulk requests. This minimizes the time for shoppers while updating items to their cart. Shoppers can even update multiple items with the same or different shipping groups to their cart.

        When you update multiple items that qualify for free gifts in the cart, the corresponding free gifts for all eligible products are also automatically updated in the cart.

        ### Add Product to Cart

        Adding a Product to Cart is the most common Cart action. If you want to add any custom products or promotions, you need to do that as a separate action.

        #### Dynamic Bundles

        A bundle is a purchasable product that is composed of a combination of two or more products that you want to sell together. You can create multiple components within a bundle. Each component can have one or more options. Each option is a product and a quantity. You can configure minimum and/or maximum values for the number of product options in a component that your shoppers can select. For example, you can enable a shopper to select 1 or more product options from a list of 10. These are called [dynamic bundles](/docs/api/pxm/products/products#dynamic-bundles).

        Your dynamic bundles are displayed in your published catalogs.

        1. Use the configure a shopper endpoint to allow shoppers to make their selections from a bundle.
        2. In the response of the configure a shopper, the `bundle_configuration` object contains the bundle selections a shopper has made.
        3. In the add a product to cart request, use the `bundle_configuration` object to add the customers selections to a cart.

        ```json
          "bundle_configuration": {
               "selected_options": {
                   "games": {
                       "d7b79eb8-19d8-45ea-86ed-2324a604dd9c": 1
                   },
                   "toys": {
                       "0192ccdd-6d33-4898-87d7-c4d87f2bf8ea": 1,
                       "1aea6f97-f0d9-452c-b3c1-7fb5629ead82": 1
                   }
               }
        }
        ```

        When a cart is checked out, the options a shopper selected are added to the order. See [order items](/docs/api/carts/get-order-items).

        #### Personalized Products

        You can allow shoppers to personalize their goods by adding custom text inputs to products directly. This feature is particularly useful for customizable items, such as personalized T-shirts or greeting cards. You can use this functionality by leveraging the `custom_inputs` attribute, and defining the details and validation rules for the custom text.

        First, you must configure a `custom_inputs` attribute when creating a new product or updating an existing product. Once you have defined your custom inputs on a product, you must configure the custom inputs in your orders.

        For example, you may sell T-shirts that can have personalized text on the front and back of the shirt.

        ```json
            {
              "data": {

              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        If the same product has different `custom_inputs` attributes, then these are added as separate items in a cart.

        The `custom_inputs` attribute is stored in the cart item and the text for `custom_input` must not exceed 255 characters in length. When a cart is checked out, the `custom_inputs` attribute becomes part of the order.

        #### Limitations on Usage of `custom_inputs` with Specific Promotion Types

        When you add products to a cart with `custom_inputs`, there are certain limitations on usage of the `custom_inputs` with the following promotion types:

          - For [Free Gift Promotions](/docs/api/promotions/create-a-promotion), you can add `custom_inputs` to gift items.
          - For [Fixed Bundle Discount Promotions](/docs/api/promotions/create-a-promotion), the promotion applies as long as the cart contains the bundle SKUs even when there are different `custom_inputs`.
          - For [X for Y Discount Promotion and X for amount discount promotion](/docs/api/promotions/create-a-promotion), the promotion applies when there are two SKUs with the same `custom_inputs`. The promotion does not apply when there are different `custom_inputs` and the SKUs are in different line items.

        #### Stock locations

        When adding to a cart it is possible to specify which [stock location](/docs/api/pxm/inventory_mli/inventories-introduction?#multi-location-inventories) should be used for tracking inventory for that product by specifying its slug in `location`. This might represent the warehouse a product is shipped from or the store holding the stock in a Buy Online Pick Up In Store scenario.

        Each line item is restricted to a single stock location. If the same product is added with a different location then the most recently-specified location will be used for the total quantity of that line item.

        :::note

        - Any requests to add a product to cart returns the collection of cart items.
        - [Tax items](/docs/api/carts/tax-items) may optionally be added with the product. Only administrators with [client_credentials access tokens](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token) are able to do this. If included, they replace any existing taxes on the product.
        - The cart currency is set when the first item is added to the cart.
        - The product being added to the cart requires a price in the same currency as the other items in the cart. The API returns a 400 error if a price is not defined in the correct currency.
        - A cart can contain a maximum of 100 unique items. Items include products, custom items, tax items, and promotions.
        - There are a number of actions that happen to your inventory when checking out and paying for an order. For more information, see the [Inventory](/docs/api/pxm/inventory/inventories-introduction) documentation.

        ### Including Resources

        When you make an `Add Product to Cart` request to the catalog-view service, you can obtain details of the component products. If you include the optional parameter `include=component_products` in the request, the response will include details for each component product.

        When a bundle with selected component products is added to a cart, the cart displays both the bundle pricing and component product IDs.

        The response example is returned with a new field called `component_products` under `bundle_configuration`, which is a list of component products that the user has selected for dynamic bundles.

        | Parameter               | Required     | Description        |
        |:------------------------|:-------------|:-------------------|
        | `component_products`    | Optional     | The component product data and key attribute data, such as SKU or slug, to return for component products in a product bundle. |
        | `main_image`            | Optional     | The main images associated with a product. |
        | `files`                 | Optional     | Any files associated with a product. |

            ]
        }
        ```

        See [Including Resources](https://elasticpath.dev/guides/Getting-Started/includes).

        ### Add Subscription to Cart

        To add a subscription to your cart, you need to provide the ID of the subscription offering and the ID of the plan within that offering that you want to subscribe to.

        ```json
          {
            {
              "data": {
                "id": "5b9be99f-1c94-4ddd-9718-81adab0cc3e0",
                "type": "subscription_item",
                "quantity": 1,
                "subscription_configuration": {
                  "plan": "40010dde-2f38-489b-8b3f-14a13cbfb431"
                }
            }
          }
        ```

        The price of the subscription item in the cart reflects the cost of the subscription's initial billing period. Once the cart has been checked out and the order paid for, the subscription will be automatically created in the subscriptions service.

        ### Add Custom Item to Cart

        You can add a custom item to the cart when you don't manage things like shipping, taxes and inventory in Commerce.

        For [Shipping Groups](/docs/ship-groups/shipping-groups/index), once you have created a [cart shipping group](/docs/ship-groups/shipping-groups/shipping-groups-api/create-cart-shipping-group), you need to link it to the cart items. This is important, because it is necessary to associate items with shipping groups in order to include shipping groups in the corresponding cart, order, and totals.

        :::note

        - Custom Cart Items are available when using [implicit access tokens](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token). Ensure that you always check each order has the correct details for each item, most importantly, price.

        :::

        ### Add Promotion to Cart

        You can use the Promotions API to apply discounts to your cart as a special cart item type. Any requests to add a product to cart will return a collection of cart items.

         There are certain limitations on usage of the `custom_inputs` attribute with some promotion types. See [Limitations on Usage of `custom_inputs` with Specific Promotion Types](/docs/api/carts/manage-carts#limitations-on-usage-of-custom_inputs-with-specific-promotion-types).

        To remove promotion from the cart via the promotion code, see [Delete Promotion Code from Cart](/docs/api/carts/delete-a-promotion-via-promotion-code).

        ### Re-order

        From a shopper’s order history, they can add the items from a previous order into their carts. Shoppers can add items regardless of past order status, such as incomplete or not paid. For more information, see [Orders](/docs/api/carts/orders).

        :::note
          - Any requests to add an item to cart return a collection of [cart items](/docs/api/carts/cart-items).
          - A cart can contain a maximum of 100 unique items. Items include products, custom items, and promotions.
          - When a shopper creates a cart and re-orders items from an order with properties such as custom attributes, custom discounts, and payment intent ID, these properties will remain unchanged in the original cart.
          - Custom items do not exist in catalogs, and therefore cannot be reordered.
        :::

        ### Merging Carts

        A shopper can have multiple carts, and the system may automatically merge items from an anonymous cart into the shopper's registered cart when they sign in. For example, if a shopper has an existing cart with items `A`, `B` and `C`, and later adds items `D` and `E` while not signed in, the system can merge these carts when the shopper signs in. After the carts merge, the cart contains items `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E`.

        If any items are duplicated from the anonymous cart to the registered cart, their quantities are incremented accordingly. For example, if a shopper's existing cart with items `A`, `B` and `C`, and they later add two more `A` items and one `B` item while not signed in, the system will merge the carts when the shopper signs in. The existing cart will now contain three `A` items, two `B` items, and one `C` item.

        :::note

        When the system merges items from one cart into another cart, properties such as custom attributes, custom discounts, and payment intent ID will remain unchanged in the original cart.

        :::

        ### Best Practices

        We recommend to include a unique `sku` code within the request body while adding custom items to carts. If the same `sku` is used for multiple products, they are merged into a single line item.

        For example, if a cart consists of the following items:

        - `product-1` with quantity 1 and sku code as `sku-1`
        - `product-2` with quantity 1 and sku code as `sku-1`
        - `product-3` with quantity 1 and sku code as `sku-2`.

        The following response is returned where it combines all products with the same sku codes into a single line item, while products with a unique sku codes are represented as separate items:

      summary: Bulk Add Tax Items to Cart
      description: |
        :::note

        A cart item can only have a maximum of five tax items.

        :::

        ### Errors

        `422 Unprocessable Entity`

        In this example, when `options.add_all_or_nothing` is set to `true` and if one of cart items is not found or has reached its maximum tax item limit, the following error response is returned:

        ```json
        {
                    "status": 422,
                    "title": "Add all or nothing.",
                    "detail": "Add all or nothing set to (true). Could not bulk add tax items to cart."
                }

        ```

        In this example, if you add more than five tax items to the same cart item, the following error response is returned:

        ```json
        {
                    "status": 422,
                    "title": "Tax item not added to cart item.",
                    "detail": "Cannot exceed tax item limit of (5) on cart item.",
                    "meta": {
                        "id": "f88e6370-cb35-40b2-a998-c759f31dec0a"
                    }
                }
        ```

        `404`

        In this example, if there is a mismatch between `cart_item`/`custom_item` and the `relationships.item.data.type` specified in the bulk add tax item, the following error response is returned:

        ```json
        {
            "data": [],
            "errors": [
                {
                    "status": 404,
                    "title": "Tax item not added to cart item.",
                    "detail": "Mismatch between bulk tax item type(cart_item) and cart item type(custom_item).",
                    "meta": {
                        "id": "56aab5d1-1dd4-45ed-88ed-4d0cc396b62d"

                },
                {
                    "status": 404,
                    "title": "Tax item not added to cart item.",
                    "detail": "Mismatch between bulk tax item type(cart_item) and cart item type(custom_item).",
                    "meta": {
                        "id": "56aab5d1-1dd4-45ed-88ed-4d0cc396b62d"

        - Payments
      summary: Create Stripe Payment Intent for a Cart
      description: |
        The Cart Payment Intent feature enables the creation of a Stripe Payment Intent specifically tied to a shopping cart and its subsequent order. This allows Payment Intent users to track payment details from the cart stage and seamlessly maintain consistency in payment information throughout the order stage. Using these features, you can create Payment Intents for their carts, update Payment Intents with final cart details, and synchronize Payment Intents from Stripe to Commerce.

        :::note

        - Typically, in Commerce, inventory is allocated at the time of payment initiation after an order is created. However, in the case of Cart Payment Intent, information about the payment is received only upon synchronizing the order from Stripe to Commerce. This may happen after the payment is completed. Therefore, there might be a delay between the payment made and allocation, increasing the chance of paying for items that are not in stock.
        - There are certain fields you can choose to set up when [creating a payment intent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/create). However, if you decide to update a payment intent, the available options may not be the same as those allowed while creating a payment intent. See [updating a payment intent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/update).

        :::

        The following steps outline the workflow associated with the Payment Intent:

        1. [Add items to cart](/docs/api/carts/manage-carts#add-custom-item-to-cart).
        1. [Create a Payment Intent for the cart](/docs/api/carts/create-cart-payment-intent). The Payment Intent is created in Stripe, reflecting the cart and transaction details, including currency, amounts, payment type, and any optional Stripe details. The Payment Intent ID is generated and linked to the cart.
        1. [Update a Payment Intent](/docs/carts-orders/update-cart-payment-intent). This step is optional but becomes necessary when there are changes in the cart details at the time of payment. It ensures the Payment Intent accurately reflects the current cart details when processing the payments on the front end.
        1. [Checkout the cart](/docs/api/carts/checkout). An unpaid order is created, and the Payment Intent ID is linked to the order.
        1. [Confirm the order](/docs/carts-orders/confirm-an-order). This is important because after checkout, it is essential to confirm the Payment Intent and synchronize it with Commerce. This results in a corresponding transaction and change in order statuses in Commerce. Additionally, the Payment Intent ID is removed from the order once it is linked via the transaction.

        ### Best Practices

        We recommend you follow these practices to maintain consistency and accuracy when using Cart Payment Intent.

        - After checkout, we recommend clearing the shopping cart. You can achieve this using a [Delete a cart](/docs/api/carts/delete-a-cart) endpoint or [Update a cart](/docs/api/carts/update-a-cart) to remove the Payment Intent ID. This helps to avoid potential issues where subsequent checkouts for the same cart might unintentionally use the previous Stripe Payment Intent ID.
        - If it is not reasonable to clear the cart immediately after checkout due to several subsequent, duplicate checkouts to the same cart, ensure that you only synchronize the Payment Intent when finalizing the order. Each order confirmation is unaware of the others, and syncing Payment Intent IDs for each confirmation can lead to duplicate transactions in Commerce. In other words, if you synchronize Payment Intents for earlier versions of a repeated checkout, you'll end up with multiple orders from the same cart, each having transactions linked to the same Payment Intent.
        - To pay the entire amount at once, use the [Update Cart Payment Intent](/docs/carts-orders/update-cart-payment-intent) endpoint to update the Stripe Payment Intent with the final cart details when preparing to take the payment. Doing so, ensures that the Payment Intent accurately reflects the current cart details when processing payments on the front end. We do not recommend calling the [Update Cart Payment Intent](/docs/carts-orders/update-cart-payment-intent) for each individual change in the cart, as this can lead to more requests and may slow down the front-end performance.

      summary: Checkout API
      description: |
        When a Cart is ready for checkout, you can convert the cart to an order. The cart remains and can be modified and checked out again if required.

        A cart can be checked out with a customer ID, customer object, or with an account by authenticating with the `Client Credentials Token`.

        After a successful checkout, a response that contains the order is returned. If the cart is linked to a shipping group, the shipping group is also associated with the order after checkout.

        You can checkout using one of the following methods:
        - **Customer ID**: You can checkout a cart with an existing customer ID.
        - **Guest Checkout** (Checkout with Customer Object): You can checkout a cart with an associated customer name and email.
        - **Checkout with Account**: The shopper authenticates with the `Client Credentials` Token.
        - **Checkout with Account Management Authentication Token**: The shopper authenticates with the `Implicit Token` and the `EP-Account-Management-Authentication-Token`.

        :::note

        - The cart currency is set when the first item is added to the cart.
        - The product being added to the cart requires a price in the same currency as the other items in the cart. The API returns a 400 error if a price is not defined in the correct currency.
        - To ensure that a free gift is automatically applied to an order, set the promotion to automatic. The checkout process will not be successful if free gift items are out of stock. See [Errors](#errors) section.

        :::

        :::caution

        - By default, carts are automatically deleted 7 days after the last update. You can change this setting by [updating cart settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).
        - Your inventory is modified during checkout and payment of an order. For more information about the changes in the inventory, see the [Inventory](/docs/api/pxm/inventory/inventories-introduction) section.

        :::

         You can pass `order_number` and `external_ref` in the checkout endpoint or when [updating an order](/docs/api/carts/update-an-order). The `order_number` is an optional, user-managed field that is used as an alternative to `order_id`. When processing transactions through Authorize.net, the `order_number` is sent instead of the `order_id`, and it will appear in the invoice number section. If no `order_number` is provided, the `order_id` is sent to Authorize.net on payment by default. There are no duplication restrictions on the `order_number` value.

        ### Next Steps

        After a cart has been converted to an Order using either of the previous methods, you most likely want to capture payment for order. See [Paying for an Order](/docs/api/carts/payments).

        ### Errors

        The following error response is returned during checkout when an eligible item is added to the cart, and the free gift is out of stock.

        ```json
        {
            "errors": [

        This endpoint returns all orders with custom flow fields. The pagination offset is set to fetch a maximum of 10,000 orders. If the store has 10,000 orders and you fetch the orders without using filters, an error is returned. Use a filter to view orders when the order is beyond the 10,000 mark.

        :::note

        - Pass the `X-Moltin-Customer-Token` header to limit orders to a specific customer. See [Customer Tokens](/docs/customer-management/customer-management-api/customer-tokens).
        - Pass the `EP-Account-Management-Authentication-Token` header to limit orders to a specific account. See [Account Management Token](/docs/api/accounts/post-v-2-account-members-tokens).
        - You can use pagination with this resource. For more information, see [pagination](/guides/Getting-Started/pagination).

      summary: Update an Order
      description: |
        You can only update custom data, `shipping`, `shipping_address`, and status of orders. All other settings in the order object are immutable.

         This endpoint allows you to:

        - **Update an order number and external reference**: You can update an existing order that does not have an `order_number` and `external_ref`, modify the `order_number` and `external_ref` values, or remove them by passing an empty value in the `order_number` and `external_ref` fields.
        - **Cancel an order**: You can cancel an order only if it has not been fulfilled.
        - **Fulfill an order**: You can fulfill a paid order only.

        :::caution

        You can update `shipping`, `shipping_address`, and status of an order only if the order is not fulfilled. You can use the refund API to refund an order only if the payment status is `paid`. Canceling an order does not automatically refund a payment. You must refund the orders manually.

        :::

        :::note

        - This request is only accessible to client credentials token users with Seller Admin role.
        - Non client credentials token users cannot access this endpoint. See [Permissions](/docs/authentication/Tokens/permissions).
        - The `order_number` will appear as the invoice number in Authorize.net transactions.

      summary: Payment Setup
      description: |
        Depending on the payment gateway, you may have access to different transaction types such as capturing funds immediately or authorizing them for later. For more information, see [Transactions](/docs/api/carts/transactions).

        The following types of payment methods are available depending on the payment gateway:

        - `purchase`: This is the simplest method. The gateway attempts to charge the customer immediately.
        - `authorize`: This method authorizes a payment so that funds can be captured later, for example, when an item is dispatched or restocked.
        - `purchase_setup`: This method prepares the system for a purchase by verifying payment details without actually charging the customer. For example, a customer adds items to their cart and proceeds to checkout. Before finalizing the purchase, the system runs `purchase_setup` to confirm all payment details, but no funds are transferred until the customer confirms the order.
        - `authorize_setup`: This method prepares the system for an authorization-only transaction. This process holds the necessary funds but does not transfer them, ensuring that the customer has sufficient balance for the transaction. It sets up the conditions for a future capture of the authorized funds. For example, a customer places a pre-order for a product that will ship in two weeks. The merchant uses `authorize_setup` to prepare for the payment authorization. This holds the customer's funds to ensure they can cover the purchase but waits to capture the payment until the product ships. This ensures that payment is secured but not collected prematurely.

        :::note

        Split payments can be performed using any methods for any gateway.

        - You can partially pay funds using `purchase` method. The gateway attempts to charge the customer immediately, and the payment status for an order will show `partially_paid`
        - You can partially pay for an order using `authorize` method where the order will be marked as `partially_authorized`. The transaction must be completed for the order status to be `partially_authorized`.
        - A `purchase_setup` method allows verification of payment details for partial payments without transferring funds until the customer confirms the full order.
        - An `authorize_setup` method can be used to hold a partial amount of the total funds, ensuring the customer has enough balance for a future capture.
        Until a payment is made neither `purchase_setup` nor `authorize_setup` affects the payment statuses, and the order remains unpaid. For more information about order and payment statuses for split payments, see [Split payments](/docs/api/payments/payment-gateways-introduction#split-payments).

        Confirm Payment serves as a mechanism to synchronize transaction information from the third-party payment provider back to our system. This ensures that Composable Commerce accurately reflects the values from the payment provider.

        ### Handling 3D Secure Validations for Stripe Payments

        For Stripe Payments requiring 3D Secure validation, the transaction response will include the `client_parameters` object, which provides credentials to support validation of these payment requests on the payment provider's side. We recommend using the Stripe's client libraries to manage these 3D Secure validations. Once the validation succeeds, proceed with a confirmation request to sync the validated transaction into Composable Commerce and continue with the payment process.

      description: |
        There are two ways to refund; through your payment gateway and mark it refunded in Commerce Manager, or directly through Commerce Manager or API.

        * Mark as Refunded: You can manually mark a transaction as refunded. Before you can mark the order as refunded, you need to handle the actual refund on your side with your payment provider. Mark as Refunded is a full refund made to the transaction.
        * Refund through Composable Commerce: You can process a full or partial refund to a supported payment provider directly from Commerce Manager or API by providing the refund amount. When you start the refund process, the request is directly sent to the payment gateway.

        :::caution

        If you use manual gateway for partial or full refund, you need to handle the actual refund on your side with your payment provider.

    description: |
      A Cart contains the product and custom cart items that a user intends to purchase. After a Cart is ready for Checkout, you can use the [Checkout endpoint](/docs/api/carts/checkout) to convert the cart to an order.

      :::note

      - Adding, modifying, or removing any cart items, custom items, or promotions always returns the cart meta, calculated using the calculation method. This is useful to update the client with up-to-date totals.
      - We will automatically delete carts 7 days after they were last updated.
      - If you do not pass a `X-MOLTIN-CURRENCY` header specifying what currency you would like the cart to use, the products in the cart are converted to your default currency.

  - name: Account Cart Associations
    description: |
      You can create associations between an account and one or more carts. After cart associations exist for an account, those carts are accessible across any device. You can delete associations as required.

      There are two ways to access the cart: with an [Account Management Authentication Tokens](/docs/api/accounts/post-v-2-account-members-tokens) and without one.

      ### With an `Account Management Authentication` token

      These endpoints are for users who authenticated implicitly and require an Account Management Authentication token in the header to access the account cart associations APIs. For more information, see the [Account Token](/docs/api/accounts/post-v-2-account-members-tokens) documentation.

      #### Cart creation

      Shoppers create carts and can use any of the carts that they created to check out an order.

      :::note

      You can create a cart id, name, and description for the cart. The cart requires a name. Ensure that the string length is greater than or equal to one. Use any symbol in the name and description. For cart id, ensure that you follow the guidelines for safe characters. For more information about cart id naming requirements, see [Safe Characters](/guides/Getting-Started/safe-characters).

      :::

      ### Without an `Account Management Authentication` token

      These endpoints are for users who use the Client Credentials Token and do not require an account management authentication token in the header to access the account cart associations APIs. For more information, see the [Authentication](/docs/authentication/security) documentation.

      This user acts as a system administrator and can call any account cart association operations for any account and cart.

      ### Error Codes

      You might encounter the following response codes, depending on the scenario:

      * `400` - `The type does not exist or is not listed as account` - Ensure that the type is `account` and is present.

      * `403` - `Cannot associate more than one account`.

      * `403` - `Account does not have the required permissions to fulfill this request`.

      * `403` - `Invalid json payload` - Check JSON input. The request body must be an array `[]`. If the request body is an object, the error is generated.

  - name: Checkout
    description: |

      The checkout workflow ties together many of the key concepts covered in this section. When a customer initiates the checkout process, an order is created from the cart. The order is incomplete until after a successful payment is made. A complete order can be shipped and the product deducted from inventory counts.

      ![Checkout workflow](/assets/checkout-flow.png)

      ### Summary of the checkout workflow

      1. Add a product to a cart. A cart and its reference number is generated.
      2. Manage the cart items. For example, you might add items, remove items, and change quantities.
      3. Check out the cart. An incomplete order is created.
      4. Pay for an order: provide billing and shipping details, if you are a new customer. The order is now in the processing status.
      5. If using a manual gateway, after you authorize and capture it, Composable Commerce considers the order complete. If you use a third-party integration supported by Composable Commerce (such as Stripe), after the third-party gateway authorizes and captures the payment, the order becomes complete. Usually capture does not occur at the same time as authorization. For more information, see the Capture section.
      6. After the order is shipped, you can manually flag it as fulfilled.

      ### Carts

      When a product is added to a cart, a cart is generated together with its unique reference ID that on checkout becomes a part of the order ID. If you are using our JavaScript software development kit, generating a cart reference ID is done for you; otherwise, add a cart reference generator to your functionality.

      ### Promotions and custom items

      Optionally, apply a promotion code on a cart, or add custom_items to modify the product price (typically to handle taxes, customs, or shipping).

      ### Checkout

      You can checkout a cart with an associated customer name and email (customer object). Typically, this would be used for new customers or ones that prefer to shop as guests. Use the customer.id checkout option to checkout for an existing customer. After a successful checkout is completed, the response contains an order.

      Email addresses that either begin or end with a period, or contain consecutive periods, are considered invalid, resulting in the following error:
      ```json
      "errors": [
        {
            "status": 400,
            "source": "data.customer.email",
            "title": "format",
            "detail": "Does not match format 'email'"
        }
      ]
        ```

      ### Payments

      On checkout, an incomplete order is created. You can then use a third-party integration to handle your payment gateway. If the payment gateway is supported by Composable Commerce, such as Stripe, the payment is processed externally but handled internally. When a successful validation is returned, Composable Commerce flags the order as complete.

      If you are using a payment method not officially supported by Composable Commerce, the gateway needs to be implemented and handled manually. After the payment has been authorized and captured either through Commerce Manager or API, the status of an order becomes complete.

      ### Shipping

      The status of an order and the status of shipping are handled separately, and so an order can be complete but not shipped. Orders that have not been shipped yet have a status of unfulfilled. This flag is generated automatically by Composable Commerce when an order is created. Currently, you can only update the shipping status manually, through the API. After the order is shipped, flag its shipping status as fulfilled.

      ### Inventory

      If enabled, you can manage your stock. As such, your stock is automatically updated as soon as a product is checked out.

  - name: Orders
    description: |
      An Order is created through the [checkout](/docs/api/carts/checkout) endpoint within the Carts API.

      An order is created after a customer checks out their cart. On creation, the order is marked unpaid. The customer is prompted for a shipping address, a billing address, and a payment method. After the order is successfully paid, you can trigger an inventory process and a shipping process.

      You can keep a history of orders associated with the customer account.

      ### Reorder

      A re-order is when a shopper copies items from a previous order from their order history into a cart of their choice. If a shopper re-orders to an empty cart, the same quantities as the past order are applied. If the shopper re-orders to an existing cart, and orders the same item, the quantity increases. If an item is out of stock, the item is not added to the cart, and the shopper sees an insufficient stock error. The tax for the items in a re-order is not applied. For more information, see [Tax Items](/docs/api/carts/tax-items).
  - name: Payments
    description: |
      When you [checkout](/docs/api/carts/checkout) a [cart](/docs/api/carts/cart-management), an unpaid [order](/docs/api/carts/orders) is returned. You can process the payment for the order though a payment gateway.

      :::note

      - You need to configure and enable a payment gateway before you can accept payments for orders.
      - Configure your store to use [Manual Gateway](/docs/api/payments/update-manual-gateway) to process payments if the order total is zero or the payment is through non-supported payment providers.
      - There are a number of actions that happen to your inventory when checking out and paying for an order. For more information, see [Inventory](/docs/api/pxm/inventory/inventories-introduction).
      - We recommend to wait until the payment confirmation process is fully completed before proceeding with any additional updates to the order. Making simultaneous updates to the same entity immediately after payment confirmation can lead to a race condition. To learn more information on handling parallel calls to API objects, see [Parallel Calls to API Objects](/guides/Getting-Started/api-contract#parallel-calls-to-api-objects).

      ### Payment Methods

      Depending on the chosen gateway, you may or may not have access to capture funds immediately or authorize for later payment. For more information, see [Transactions](/docs/api/carts/transactions).

      To make a partial payment in Postman through any payment gateway, specify the desired payment amount in the amount field within the request body. To learn about Split Payments, see the [Split Payments](/docs/api/payments/payment-gateways-introduction#split-payments) section.

      #### Purchase

      The simplest method is purchase. The gateway attempts to charge the customer immediately, and the result of the attempt is returned.

      You can partially pay funds using purchase method. The gateway attempts to charge the customer immediately, and the payment status for an order shows `partially_paid`.

      When you Get an order, you can see the following fields in the meta object:

      - `balance_owing`: Specifies the outstanding funds required to complete an order. It considers all complete or pending transactions, including authorized, paid, and captured transactions. (`balance_owing` = order total - `authorized` amount - `paid` amount).
      - `paid`: Specifies the total amount of purchased or captured transactions.
      - `authorized`: Specifies the total amount of completed or pending authorized transactions for an order.

      #### Authorize

      You can `authorize` a payment so funds can later be captured when an item is dispatched or restocked.

      You can partially pay for an order using `authorize` payment method so that the order is `partially_authorized`. The transaction must be complete for the order status to be `partially_authorized`.

      For more information about order and payment statuses for split payments, see [Split Payments](/docs/api/payments/payment-gateways-introduction#split-payments).

      #### Capture

      After authorizing a transaction, you have to capture the authorized funds.

      :::note

      We recommend capturing payments several hours to days after the authorization to mitigate risks of fraud and chargebacks. When you sell digital goods that are delivered immediately, we recommend using a single purchase call instead of separate authorize and capture calls.

      :::

      After the payment is `partially_authorized`, you must `capture` the authorized transaction later. Once you capture the authorized transactions, the order payment status will change to `partially_paid`.

      #### Refunds

      You can use either the Refund through Composable Commerce or use the Mark as Refunded capability, or a combination of both capabilities.

      For more information about refund for split payments, see [Refund a Payment](/docs/api/carts/refund-a-transaction).

      #### Refund through Composable Commerce

      You can start a full or partial refund to a supported payment provider directly from Commerce Manager or the API. When you start the refund process, the refund request is sent to the payment gateway. You no longer have to log on to your payment gateway’s console to process the refund.

      When you process a refund, use the refund endpoint to pass the refund amount. If you don’t pass an amount, the refund is processed as Mark as refunded. For more information, see the Mark as Refunded section.

      Each time a partial refund is triggered, the transaction.updated event is generated and updated with refunded.amount. The `order.updated` event is also triggered. The `order.refunded` event generates when the full amount is refunded.


      #### Mark as Refunded

      You can use your payment gateway’s console to process a refund. Process the refund first in the payment gateway and then use the **Mark as Refunded** capability in Composable Commerce to complete the process.

      When an order is **Marked as refunded**, the payment status `order.payment.status` is set to refunded. In this case, the `order.updated`, `transaction.updated` and `order.refunded` events are generated.
  - name: Transactions
  - name: Custom Discounts
    description: |
      With custom discounts, you can allow your shoppers to apply discounts from external services to their purchases. To apply custom discounts to carts and cart items, you need to set `custom_discounts_enabled` field to `true` in your [Cart Settings](/docs/api/settings/put-v-2-settings-cart).

      You cannot add custom discounts to an empty cart.

      :::caution

      - You can apply up to five custom discounts to cart and cart item.
      - The stores that use [simple calculation method](/guides/How-To/Carts/calculate-totals) do not support custom discounts.

      :::
  - name: Tax Items
    description: |
      Taxes differ by country and can differ within the country by region, state, or province. Each jurisdiction has a unique tax code and rate. If your store serves many jurisdictions, integrate a third-party tax generator to manage taxes. If your store serves a few jurisdictions, you can use the API to define the tax codes and rates in Composable Commerce.

      Taxes are calculated after all promotional discounts have been applied. When calculating taxes on a cart or order, you can choose from the following methods for calculating taxes:

        - Simple calculation method: Taxes are calculated at the unit level and are rounded to the nearest penny for the unit.
        - Line calculation method: Default. Taxes are calculated at the line level and are rounded to the nearest penny for the line.
          For more information about calculation methods, see [Calculate cart and order totals](/guides/How-To/Carts/calculate-totals).

      :::note
      Tax items can be added and removed using [client_credentials access tokens](/docs/api/authentication/create-an-access-token). Only administrators with `client-credentials` access tokens are able to manage tax items.
