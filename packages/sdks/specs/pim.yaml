  title: Product Experience Manager Introduction
  description: |

    Product Experience Manager uses the PIM service to manage product information, hierarchies, and price books. Ideally, Product Experience Manager becomes the single source of truth for product data across your organization.

    In Commerce, the product data is stored separately from pricing, catalogs, and inventory. This separation means that you retrieve all product data only when you are managing product data and assets. Otherwise, when setting prices or managing inventory, you retrieve a reference to the product rather than the entire product, which makes the response times very fast.

    You also have the flexibility to create catalogs for different scenarios by combining hierarchies of products with a price book. Scenarios might include:

    - **Multiple geographical regions**. Display different catalogs in different regions with suitable pricing or combine product hierarchies from two different regions to display in a third region.
    - **Multiple channels**. Display different catalogs based on how a shopper accesses your store, such as through a mobile app or a web storefront.
    - **Direct to business versus direct to customers**. Offer different products and prices for business customers versus retail customers.
    - **Preferred customers**. Offer special pricing to preferred customers while displaying a standard price catalog to all other shoppers.
    - **Reward programs**. Enable reward programs where catalog prices drop after a certain spending level is reached.
    - **Product sales**. Offer sale items for a limited time.

    Scenarios are created by defining the context within which a catalog is displays. Contexts can be a customer ID, a channel, or any other user-defined tag that can be passed to the APIs from the front-end shopper experiences.

      #### Creating Dynamic Bundles: An Overview

      The following steps are an overview of how to use dynamic bundles.

      1. Create your products using [**create a product**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
      1. Create a bundle using [**create a bundle**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
      1. Specify minimum and/or maximum values for the number of product options that can be selected within the bundle. For example, if you want the shopper to select exactly 4 out of 10 options, set both the minimum and maximum values to 4 for each of the 10 product options.
      1. For each product option in the bundle, specify if it is a default option by adding `"default": true` to the product options that you want to be pre-selected for the shopper.
      1. Publish the bundle to your catalog using the [Publish a catalog](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/publish-release) endpoint so you can display the products to your shoppers in your storefront.
      1. When a shopper interacts with the bundle on your storefront, they can select the products they want from the list of options. Use the [configure a shopper bundle](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/configure-by-context-product) endpoint to capture the shoppers selections. This updates the `bundle_configuration` with the product options chosen by a shopper.
      1. Once a shopper has configured their bundle, use the add a product to a cart endpoint to add the selected bundle to the shopper’s cart.
      1. When the shopper proceeds to checkout, the selected product options from the bundle are included in the order.

      ### Bundles of Bundles

      <BundlesBundles></BundlesBundles>

      #### Creating Bundles of Bundles: An Overview

      To create a bundle of bundles, simply add a bundle as a component to another bundle.

      1. Create your products using [**create a product**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
      1. Create all your child bundles using [**create a bundle**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product).
      1. [**Create a parent bundle**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product) and specify the product ID of your child bundle as an option of a component in your bundle. You cannot have more than 1500 options in a bundle.

      With Product Experience Manager, you can create and manage bundles. A bundle is a purchasable product, consisting of one or more products that you want to sell together.

      You can create multiple components within a bundle. Each component must have at least one or more options. Each option is a product and a quantity.

      ### Child Products

      <ChildProducts />

      ### Building Child Products

      <BuildChildren />

      ### Sorting the Order of Variations and Options

      The `variation_matrix` object lists the variation IDs and variation option IDs and their corresponding product IDs that are generated when the variation and variation options are built with a product. The `variation_matrix` can then be added to your catalogs.

      The order of the variations in the `variation_matrix` is the order of the variations in the array when the variations were linked to the product. For example, the first variation in the `variation_matrix` corresponds to the first variation in the array, and so on. You can use the `sort_order`attribute to sort the order of your variation and variation options in the `variation_matrix` object. The sort order value is visible when you add the variations and variation options to your catalogs. You can then use the `sort_order` value to program your storefront to display the variations and variation options in the order that you want.

      Add the `sort_order` attribute to the body of your request and specify a `sort_order` value. A `sort_order` value must be a number. You can specify any numbers that you want.

      - 1, 2, 3, or 100, 90, 80, and so on.
      - Zero or negative numbers.

      You can set `sort_order` to either `null` or omit it entirely from the request if you wish to remove an existing `sort_order` attribute.

      :::caution

      - Commerce does not sort variations and variation options. You must program your storefront to sort the variations and variation options in the order that you want.
      - You must rebuild your products for the sort order changes to take effect. See [**Build Child Products**](#build-child-products).

      Products are the items or services that you might want to sell in your store. In Product Experience Manager, products can also have associated rich media assets, such as product images or a file containing additional product details.

      You can do this using [Files API](/docs/api/pxm/files).

      Once you have created your files, you associate files with your products using the [Create Product-File Relationships API](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-product-file-relationships).
  - name: Product Image Relationships

      ```mdx-code-block
      import ProductImport from '/docs/partials/pxm/import/import.mdx';

      <ProductImport />
      ```

      #### Using Imported Main Image Files

      You can use the main images that you have previously uploaded to Commerce and assign them to your products when importing products to Commerce. You can do this by adding a `main_image_id` header to your `.csv` file. The ID you provide in `main_image_id` is the ID of a file that has already been uploaded to Commerce using create a file.

      #### Importing Custom Data (Flows)

      You can also create/update custom extension data in a `.csv` file by creating a header that includes the flow `ID` and the field `slug` in the following format: 

      template:*flowID*:*fieldSlug*.

      where:

      - `template` must be `template`.
      - `flowID` is the ID of the flow that contains the field whose data you want to create/update.
      - `fieldSlug` is the slug of the field whose data you want to create/update.

      In the following example, for a flow with ID `82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b` and a field with the slug `condition`:

      - the header is `template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition`.
      - the updated custom data is `as-new`.

          | name | slug | sku | status | template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition |
          | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
          | BestEver Range | bestever-range-1a1a-30 | BE-Range-1a1a-30 | draft | as-new |

      #### Characteristics of CSV Import Files

      Product Import uses a [**Comma Separated Values (CSV)**](#characteristics-of-csv-import-files) file to import/update products, main image files, and custom extension data. 

      - Each row in a `.csv` file represents a product you want to create/update. 
      - Each file:
          - must not be larger than 50 megabytes. If a `.csv` file is larger than 50 megabytes, a `503 client read error` is displayed.
          - must not have more than 50,000 rows, including the header. If a CSV file exceeds 50,000 rows, an error is displayed, and the products are not imported.
          In other words, if you have a file with 50,000 rows that is larger than 50 megabytes, an error is displayed, and the products are not imported.
      - If you want to create/update more than 50,000 products or your `.csv` file is larger than 50 megabytes, you must have a separate `.csv` file and import each `.csv` file one at a time.
      - You can update existing products, including images, templates/flow fields, and entries. The entry in the `.csv` file must have a unique `id` and/or `external_ref` that matches the `id` and `external_ref` of the existing product you want to update. You may have both a unique `id` and `external_ref`, but you must have at least one.
      - You can add new products. For new products that you want to add, the entry in the `.csv` file must have an `external_ref` that does not match any existing products.

      The following table describes the headers that are supported.

      | Header | Required | Description  |
      |:---- |:---------|:--|
      | id                              | Optional | A unique product ID that is generated when you create the product. The `id` is used to look up products in the `.csv` file and matches them to the products in your storefront that you want to update.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
      | external_ref                    | Optional | A unique attribute associated with a product. This could be an external reference from a separate company system, for example.

      ### Characteristics of Exporting Products

      - Product exports are an asynchronous operation. When you send a request to the Export API, it triggers an asynchronous job to build the `.csv` file containing the product entries.
      - Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send product export requests, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. This process is repeated until all jobs are processed. See [**Jobs**](/docs/api/pxm/products/jobs).
      - The Export API response includes a job resource. In the response, you can verify the job status; if the status is successful, the response includes a link to the location where the `.csv` file is stored. See [**Product Export CSV File**](#product-export-csv-file). A single CSV file contains 10,000 rows, excluding the header. If you are exporting 50,000 products, the job endpoint response contains links to five `.csv` files; each `.csv` file including 10,000 products.
      - You might have specified custom extension data in a `.csv` file when you imported the products. These modifications are all exported. So, when you send a request to the Export API, the `.csv` file, included in the Job endpoint response, reflects any changes that you have made.
      - You cannot export product bundles.

      ### Product Export CSV File

      The Product Export API generates a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file that you can use to import/update products, main image files, and custom extension data. 

      The `.csv` file is:

       - Comma-separated.
       - Header-based.
         - Header attributes must be the same as the product attributes.
         - Header names can be in any order.
       - Each row after the first line represents a single product.

      The following table describes the headers that are supported.

      | Header                           | Required | Description |

      | `_created_at`                      | Optional| The date and time a product was created. **Note**: This field does not populate any data; it is provided solely for informational purposes.      |                                                                                                               
      | `_updated_at`                      | Optional | The date and time a product was updated. **Note**: This field does not populate any data; it is provided solely for informational purposes.        |                                                                                                             
      | `template:<templateID>:created_at` | Optional | The date and time a template was created. **Note**: This field does not populate any data; it is provided solely for informational purposes.         |                                                                                                           
      | `template:<templateID>:updated_at` | Optional | The date and time a template was updated. **Note**: This field does not populate any data; it is provided solely for informational purposes.      |                                                                                                              
      | `template:<flowID>:<fieldName>`  | Optional | Custom extension data includes the flow `ID` or `slug` and the field `name`. See [Exporting Custom Data (Flows)](#exporting-custom-data-flows).   |                                                                                                              

      ### Exporting Main Image Files

      The main images that you have previously uploaded Commerce are exported. A `main_image_id` header is added to your `.csv` file. The ID in `main_image_id` is the ID of a file that has already been uploaded to Commerce using [create a file](/docs/api/pxm/files/create-a-file).

      ### Exporting Custom Data (Flows)

      Custom extension data is exported in a `.csv` file by creating a header that includes the flow `ID` or `slug` and the field `name` as shown below:

      - `template:<flowSlug>:<fieldName>`
      - `template:<flowID>:<fieldName>`

      where:

      - `template` must be `template`.
      - one of the following for the template that contains the field whose data you want to export:
        - `flowID` is the ID of the flow.
        - `flowSlug` is the flow slug.
      - `fieldName` is the name of the field whose data you want to export.

      In the following example, for a flow with ID `82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b` and a field with the name `condition`:

      - the header is `template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition`.
      - the updated custom data is `as-new`.

      | name | slug | sku | status | template:82c10a02-1851-4992-8ecb-d44f2782d09b:condition |

      ## Creating Hierarchies and Nodes

      You can create the **Major Appliances** hierarchy by performing the following steps.

      1. Using [**Create a Hierarchy**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-hierarchy), create a hierarchy whose name is **Major Appliances**. Each hierarchy has a hierarchy ID. In other words, the hierarchy ID is the ID of the root node.
      1. Using [**Create a Node in a hierarchy**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-node), create the following child nodes. When you create a node in a hierarchy, by default, the node is a child of the root node. Specify `sort_order` to configure the order of the nodes.
         - **Ranges**
         - **Refrigerators**
         - **Dishwashers**
      1. Using [**Create a Node in a hierarchy**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-node), create the **Electric Ranges** node, specifying **Ranges** as the parent node.
      1. Using [**Create a Node in a hierarchy**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-node), create the following nodes, specifying **Electric Ranges** as the parent node.
         - **Electric Ranges 24ˮ**
         - **Electric Ranges 30ˮ**
         - **Double Oven**
      1. Using [**Create a Node in a hierarchy**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-node), create the **Gas Ranges** node, specifying **Ranges** as the parent node.
      1. Using [**Create a Node in a hierarchy**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-node), create the following nodes, specifying **Gas Ranges** as the parent node.
         - **Gas Ranges 24ˮ**
         - **Gas Ranges 30ˮ**
         - **Gas Ranges 32"**
         - **Double Oven**
      1. Using [**Create a Node in a hierarchy**](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-node), create the following nodes, specifying **Dishwashers** as the parent node.
          - **Built-in**
          - **Standalone**

        The jobs endpoints display the status of a number of endpoints that function as jobs, for example, product import and export, and duplicating hierarchies.

        Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send job requests, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. If you decide that a specific job needs to be prioritized over another, you can cancel the less critical job using the `Cancel a job` endpoint. You can only cancel jobs whose status is PENDING.

        Creates a product or bundle with the attributes that are defined in the body.

        #### Product Types

        Product Experience Manager automatically assigns types to the products you create. You can filter on product types. Product types can also be used in catalogs. For example, in your catalog, you can filter on `parent` so that only your parent products are displayed in your storefront. 

        See [**Product Types**](/docs/api/pxm/products/products#product-types).

        #### Product Tags

        You can use product tags to store or assign a key word against a product or service that you sell in your store. The product tag can then be used to describe or label that product. Product tags represent similarities between products who do not share the same attributes. Using product tags means that you can group your products together, for example, by brand, category, subcategory, colors, types, industries, and so on. 

        See [**Product Tags**](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-tags).

        #### Personalizing Products

        You can allow your shoppers to add custom text to a product when adding product items to their carts. This is useful, for example, if you have a product like a T-shirt that can be personalized, or you sell greetings cards that can be printed with your shoppers personalized messages. You can do this by configuring the `custom_inputs` attribute.

        When configuring the `custom_inputs` attribute:

        - You can rename `input` to something more representative of the input that shoppers are adding, for example, `message` or `front`.
        - `name` is the name that is displayed in your storefront.
        - You can add validation rules. For example, the input field must be a `string` and/or up to 255 characters in length. The limit is 255 characters.
        - You can specify if the input field is required.

        #### Curating Products

        You can curate the products in a node. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each node of your hierarchies, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. For example, you may find you have an abundance of cotton T-Shirts and you want to promote these products to the top of the product list. When a shopper navigates to T-shirts, the cotton T-Shirts are displayed first. See [**Update a node**](/docs/api/pxm/products/update-node).

        #### Bundles

        With Product Experience Manager, you can use the products API to create and manage bundles. A bundle is a purchasable product, consisting of one or more products that you want to sell together. 

        See [**Bundles**](/docs/api/pxm/products/products#bundles).

      summary: Get all products
      description: |
        Retrieves a list of all your products in the Product Experience Manager system.

        You can also use `include` to retrieve top-level resources, such as files or images, and key attribute data, such as SKU or slug for component products in a product bundle. With this option, you can get more information about the products in a product bundle in your store front, improving the buying experience for your shoppers.

        #### Filtering

         Many Commerce API endpoints support filtering. The general syntax is described in [**Filtering**](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering).

         The following attributes and operators are supported.

        | Operator          | Attribute                                                                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example                                      |
        | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |

        You can use the Product Import API to:

        - Add new products, including:

            - main image files. See [Importing Main Image Files](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update#using-imported-main-image-files).
            - custom data. See [Importing custom data](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update#importing-custom-data-flows).
            - Make bulk updates to existing products.

        You cannot use product import to:

        - Delete existing products.
        - Import product bundles.

        The Product Import API uses a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file to import products, main image files and custom extension data. Each row in a .csv file represents a product you want to create/update. See an [example file](/assets/pim_product_import_example.csv).

        Each file can have 50,000 rows, including the header. If a CSV file exceeds 50,000 rows, an error is displayed, and the products are not imported. A CSV file must not be larger than 50 megabytes. If a CSV file is larger than 50 megabytes, a `503 client read` error is displayed.

        If you want to create/update more than 50,000 products or your CSV file is larger than 50 megabytes, you must have a separate CSV file and import each CSV file one at a time.

        See [**Characteristics of CSV Files**](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update#characteristics-of-csv-import-files).

        The Export API is available to make bulk updates to products in Product Experience Manager. You might also export products for your personal requirements. 
        
        The Export API builds a CSV file containing the product entries. A CSV file can contain up to 50,000 product entries. If you have more than 50,000 product entries, then another CSV file is created and so on, until all your products are exported.

        The Job endpoint response specifies the location where the CSV file is stored. See [Characteristics of CSV Files](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-export#characteristics-of-exporting-products).

      summary: Build child products
      description: |
        With product variations in Product Experience Manager, you can create product variations and different options for each variation and use both to create child products for a product. Each child product is a unique combination of options associated with the product.  

        Child products inherit attributes from their parent products. When you make changes to the attributes of the parent products, you can rebuild your child products, ensuring that changes to the parent products are propagated to the child products.

        Alternatively, you can modify a child product independently, without impacting its parent product. For example, you may prefer the status of your child product to be `live`, while keeping the parent product's status as `draft`. When you directly update a child product, it becomes independent of its parent product. In other words, any subsequent changes made to the parent product are not automatically reflected in the child product when you rebuild the parent product and its child products. Once a child product is independent of its parent, you cannot recreate the association between the child product and its parent. You must delete the child product and rebuild the parent to recreate the child product.

        Following on from that, if you add the same flow to both a parent and child product, the child flow values are not affected by changes to the parent flow values in a rebuild.

        ### Using Build Rules

        When building your child products, you can build all products related to a product. 

        Alternatively, you can build a combination of child products associated with a product, based on build rules that you specify. This is useful, for example, if you have a variation option that you do not sell. This makes managing and building your child products quick and easy. You can do this using `build_rules`. `build_rules` are combinations of variation option IDs that you wish to include or exclude when building your child products.

        :::note

        You do not need to configure any `build_rules` in the following scenarios:

        - Child products must be built with all variation options. Simply, use the `Create a product` or `Update a product` endpoints with no `build_rules` specified.
        - Child products must be built apart from all options for a specific variation. In this case, you must remove the variation and use the `Create a product` or `Update a product` endpoints with no `build_rules` specified. In other words, using our example, if none of the `size` options should be included, then remove the `size` variation.

        :::

        The `build_rules` contain:

        - (Required) `default`: specifies the default behavior.
        - (Optional) `include`: specifies the option IDs to include when the child products are built. Each combination consists of a nested array of option IDs from one or more variations. Combinations of option IDs in the nested arrays must come from different variations. See [**Invalid Build Rules**](#invalid-build-rules).
        - (Optional) `exclude`: specifies the option IDs to exclude when the child products are built. Each combination consists of a nested array of option IDs from one or more variations. Combinations of option IDs in the nested arrays must come from different variations. See [**Invalid build rules**](#invalid-build-rules).

        When building child products, Commerce compares each combination of option IDs to these rules to determine how your child products should be built, depending on how you have configured the `build_rules`. It depends on your requirements how you configure your `build_rules`.

        #### Invalid Build Rules

        The `build_rules` are invalid if both the option IDs come from the same variation. Combinations of option IDs in the nested arrays must come from different variations.

        If Commerce cannot resolve the `build_rules` a `could not determine whether to include or exclude a child product due to ambiguous rules` error is returned. This error can occur, for example, if you have the same number of variation option IDs in both the `include` and `exclude` arrays and the variation option IDs match.

        ### Building Child Products

        Building child products is an asynchronous operation. When you build child products, a job is created. The jobId of the job is displayed in the response. When the job is complete, the build child products operation is also complete. You can use the jobId to see the status of your job using the `Get a Job` endpoint.

        Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send build child product requests, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. This process is repeated until all jobs are processed. See Jobs.

        Re-building child products after adding or removing a new variation changes the total number of child products that you can generate from a parent product. When you rebuild the child products after updating variations associated with the parent product, all existing child products that belong to a parent product are deleted. New child products are created with new product IDs.

        If you have any bundles that reference child products directly, then you must update the bundles with the new child product IDs.

        However, re-building child products after adding or removing an option does not change the existing product IDs.

      summary: Attach Custom Relationships to a Product
      description: |
        You can attach up to 5 custom relationships to a product.  

        Once you have attached a custom relationship to a product, you can then create relationships from a product to one or many other products. See [Associate a product to one or more products using a custom relationship](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-association-id). 

        See [Custom Relationships](/guides/key-concepts/product-experience-manager/custom-relationships/).

        ### Prerequisites
          - A Custom Relationship has been created, see [create a Custom Relationship](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-custom-relationship),
          - A Product has been created.

        - You can associate a product with up to 2000 other products. 
        - You do not need to attach a custom relationship to products beforehand, this will be done automatically by this endpoint. 
        - This is a partial update, so if you make a request to this endpoint multiple times with different products in each request, they will not be overwritten but will be appended to the related products list. 

        If you want to remove a relationship between products, see [Delete a Relationship between a product with one or more products](/docs/api/pxm/products/dissociate-products).  

         ### Prerequisites
           - A Custom Relationship has been created, see [create a Custom Relationship](/docs/api/pxm/products/create-custom-relationship).
           - A Product has been created for the relationship to be based from.
           - One or many Product have been created for the product to relate to.

    post:
      summary: Create a modifier
      description: |
        You can specify different modifiers for different options in a variation. When you build child products using options in variations, the properties of a child products depends on the modifier set for the options that are applied to the child product.
        
        The table below describes the different types of modifiers.

        | Modifier | Data Type | Effect |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | `name_equals` | `string` | Overrides the name of the child product with the name specified by the modifier. |
        | `name_append` | `string` | Appends the string specified in the modifier to the name of the child product. |
        | `name_prepend` | `string` | Prepends the string specified in the modifier to the name of the child product. |
        | `description_equals` | `string` | Overrides the description of the child product. |
        | `description_append` | `string` | Appends the string specified in the modifier to the description of the child product. |
        | `description_prepend` | `string` | Prepends the string specified in the modifier to the product description of the child product. |
        | `commodity_type` | `string` | Sets the commodity type of the child product, such as `physical` or `digital`. |
        | `price` | `string` | Allows application of price modifiers (`price_increment`, `price_decrement`, and `price_equals`) to the child products. |
        | `price_increment` | `string` | Increases the price of the child product. |
        | `price_decrement` | `string` | Decreases the price of the child product. |
        | `price_equals` | `string` | Sets the price of a child product to the amount you specify. |
        | `slug_append` | `string` | Appends the string specified in the modifier to the slug of the child product. Can only contain A-Z, a-z, 0 to 9, hyphen, underscore, and period. Spaces or other special characters like ^, [], *, and $ are not allowed. However, for the `slug-builder` modifier, you can use `{}` in the `seek` field, for example, `"seek": :{COLOR}"`. |
        | `slug_prepend` | `string` | Prepends the string specified in the modifier to the slug of the child product. Can only contain A-Z, a-z, 0 to 9, hyphen, underscore, and period. Spaces or other special characters like ^, [], *, and $ are not allowed. However, for the `slug-builder` modifier, you can use `{}` in the `seek` field, for example, `"seek": :{COLOR}"`. |
        | `slug_builder` | `string`| Sets a part of the slug of the child product. Can only contain A-Z, a-z, 0 to 9, hyphen, underscore, and period. Spaces or other special characters like ^, [], *, and $ are not allowed. However, for the `slug-builder` modifier, you can use `{}` in the `seek` field, for example, `"seek": :{COLOR}"`. |
        | `sku_equals` | `string` | Sets the SKU of the child product. |
        | `sku_append` | `string` | Appends the string specified in the modifier to the SKU of the child product. |
        | `sku_prepend` | `string` | Prepends the string specified in the modifier to the SKU of the child product. |
        | `sku_builder` | `string` | Sets a part of the SKU of the child product. |
        | `status` | `string` | Sets the status of the child product, such as `draft` or `live`. |

         ### Sorting Nodes in a Hierarchy
        
         You can sort the order of your nodes, regardless of where the nodes are in the hierarchy.

         You can do this by adding a `meta` object to the body of your request and specifying a `sort_order` value.
        
         The node with the highest value of `sort_order` is displayed first. For example, a node with a `sort_order` value of `3` appears before a node with a `sort_order` value of `2`.

         - If you don’t provide `sort_order` when creating nodes, all child nodes in the response for Get a Node’s Children request are ordered by the `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently updated child node first.
         - If you set `sort_order` for only a few child nodes, the child nodes with a `sort_order` value appear first and then other child nodes appear in the order of `updated_at` time.

         You can also specify a `sort_order` when creating a node relationship.

         - If you create a node (**Node A**) with a `sort_order` and then you create a relationship for **Node A** with another node (**Node B**), the `sort_order` you specified when creating **Node A** is overwritten.
         - If you create **Node A** and then you create a relationship with **Node B** but do not configure a `sort_order`, the `sort_order` you specified when you created **Node A** is not overwritten.
        
         ### Curating Products in a Node
        
          You can curate the products in a node. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each node of your hierarchies, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. For example, you may find you have an abundance of cotton T-Shirts and you want to promote these products to the top of the product list. When a shopper navigates to T-shirts, the cotton T-Shirts are displayed first.
        
          You can do this by adding a `curated_products` attribute to the body of your request and adding an array of product IDs to the attribute. You should add the products IDs in the order you want them to be displayed in your node. The first product ID is displayed first in the product list.
        
          You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20 curated products.
        
          - The product IDs you provide must exist in the specified node.
          - If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also removed from the curated_products list.
          - Once you have curated the products in a node, you can use the get node products endpoint to retrieve a list of curated products.
        
          You can then display your curated products in your catalogs using the following catalog endpoints.
        
          - Get a node in your latest catalog release.
          - Get a node in a catalog.
          - Get all nodes in your latest catalog release.
          - Get all nodes in a catalog.
          - Get node children in your latest catalog release.
          - Get node children in a catalog.

        Many Commerce API endpoints support filtering. The general syntax is described in [**Filtering**](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering).

        The following attributes and operators are supported.

        | Operator        | Attribute                                                                                 | Description                                                                                      | Example                                  |

        ### Sorting Nodes in a Hierarchy

        You can sort the order of your nodes, regardless of where the nodes are in the hierarchy.
        
         The node with the highest value of sort_order is displayed first. For example, a node with a `sort_order` value of `3` appears before a node with a `sort_order` value of `2`.
        
         - If you don’t provide `sort_order` when creating nodes, all child nodes in the response for Get a Node’s Children request are ordered by the `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently updated child node first.
         - If you set `sort_order` for only a few child nodes or not all, the child nodes with a `sort_order` value appear first and then other child nodes appear in the order of `updated_at` time.
        
         You can also specify a sort_order when creating a node relationship.

         - If you update a node (**Node A**) with a `sort_order` and then you create a relationship for **Node A** with another node (**Node B**), the `sort_order` you specified when updating **Node A** is overwritten.
         - If you have updated **Node A** and then you create a relationship with **Node B** but do not configure a `sort_order`, the `sort_order` you specified when you updated **Node A** is not overwritten.
        
         ### Curating Products in a Node

         You can curate the products in a node. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each node of your hierarchies, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. For example, you may find you have an abundance of cotton T-Shirts and you want to promote these products to the top of the product list. When a shopper navigates to T-shirts, the cotton T-Shirts are displayed first.

         You can do this by adding a `curated_products` attribute to the body of your request and adding an array of product IDs to the attribute. You should add the products IDs in the order you want them to be displayed in your node. The first product ID is displayed first in the product list.

         You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20 curated products.
        
         - The product IDs you provide must exist in the specified node.
         - If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also removed from the curated_products list.
         - Once you have curated the products in a node, you can use the get node products endpoint to retrieve a list of curated products.
        
         You can then display your curated products in your catalogs using the following catalog endpoints.
        
         - [Get a node in your latest catalog release](/docs/api/pxm/catalog/get-node)

      summary: Create relationships between a hierarchy and child nodes
      description: |
        Use this endpoint to create relationships between a hierarchy and one or more child nodes. You can create a relationship only if:

        - All child nodes already exist.
        - Every child node in the request body must belong to this hierarchy.
        - All siblings in a hierarchy must have a unique `name` and `slug`. Siblings are the child nodes that are related to the same parent.

        ### Sort Order

        You can also provide `sort_order` information when you create a relationship by adding a `meta` object to the array of node reference objects for each child node that requires sorting.

        The node with the highest value of `sort_order` appears at the top of the response. For example, a node with a `sort_order` value of `3` appears before a node with a `sort_order` value of `2`.

        - If you don’t provide `sort_order` when creating relationships, all child nodes in the response for Get a Hierarchy’s Children request are ordered by the `updated_at` time in descending order. The most recently updated child node appears at the top of the response.
        - If you set `sort_order` for only a few child nodes or not all, the child nodes with `sort_order` value appear first in the response and then other child nodes appear in the order of `updated_at` time.

        You can also specify a `sort_order` when creating and updating a node.

        - If you create or update a node (**Node A**) with a `sort_order` and then you create a relationship for **Node A** with hierarchy (**Hierarchy A**) with a new `sort_order`, the `sort_order` you specified when creating\updating **Node A** is overwritten.
        - If you create\update **Node A** and then you create a relationship with **Hierarchy A** but do not configure a `sort_order`, the `sort_order` you specified when you created\updated **Node A** is not overwritten.

      summary: Create relationships between a node and child nodes
      description: |
        Use this endpoint to create relationships between a single parent node and one or more child nodes. You can create a relationship only if:

        - The parent node already exists.
        - All child nodes already exist.
        - Every child node in the body of the request exists in the same hierarchy as the parent node.
        - A node is not a parent of itself. An array of child nodes request body must not contain the ID of the parent node in the path.
        - All siblings in a hierarchy must have a unique `slug`. Siblings are the child nodes that are related to the same parent.

        #### Filtering

        Many Commerce API endpoints support filtering. The general syntax is described in [**Filtering**](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering).

        The following attributes and operators are supported.

        | Operator        | Attribute                                                                                 | Description                                                                                      | Example                                  |

      summary: Duplicate a hierarchy
      description: |
        Using this option, you can duplicate an existing hierarchy. This is useful because it enables you to quickly and easily create multiple hierarchies with the same node structure.

        When you duplicate a hierarchy, you can specify a new name and/or a new description for the duplicated hierarchy. All other attributes, such as slug and locales, stay the same.

        Any nodes in the existing hierarchy are also replicated in the duplicated hierarchy. In addition, you can optionally use the `include_products` attribute to specify whether you want products associated with the nodes in an existing hierarchy to be associated with the nodes in the duplicated hierarchy. By default, product associations in an existing hierarchy are not duplicated in a duplicate hierarchy.

        Duplicating a hierarchy is an asynchronous operation. When you duplicate a hierarchy, a job is created. The jobId of the job is displayed in the response. When the job is complete, the duplicate hierarchy operation is also complete. You can use the jobId to see the status of your job using Get a Job.

        Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send duplicate hierarchy requests, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. This process is repeated until all jobs are processed. 

        Once the job is complete, run:

        - Get all hierarchies to retrieve the HierarchyId of your duplicated hierarchy.
        - Get a hierarchy to retrieve the nodes and (if applicable) products associated with the duplicated hierarchy.

      summary: Create a custom relationship
      description: |
        Custom relationships can either be bi-directional or uni-directional.
          - **Uni-Directional**: By setting `bi_directional` to `false` (or omitted from request) a uni-directional custom relationship will be created. 
          Within a uni-directional relationship, if Product A links to Product B, Product B will not link back to Product A. 
          This is ideal when one product (e.g., a base product) recommends another (e.g., an upsell), but the reverse 
          recommendation is unnecessary.
        
         - **Bi-Directional**: By setting `bi_directional` to `true` a bi-directional custom relationship will be created. Within a bi-directional 
         relationship, if Product A is linked to Product B, Product B will automatically link back to Product A. 
         This bi-directionality ensures a consistent experience, where products always suggest each other as related items.
        
          For more information on use cases, see [Custom Relationships](/guides/key-concepts/product-experience-manager/custom-relationships/).

        Custom Relationship slugs must meet the following criteria:
          - be unique 
          - be prefixed with `CRP_`. Product Experience Manager automatically adds the `CRP_` prefix if you do not include it.
          - contain A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9, hyphen, underscore, and period. Spaces or other special characters like ^, [], *, and $ are not allowed.
        
        Once a custom relationship has been created, you can:
           1. Add the custom relationship to a product. See [Attach a custom relationship to a product](/docs/api/pxm/products/attach-custom-relationships).
           2. Associate a product to multiple products. See [Associate a product with other products under a custom relationship](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-association-id).

        ### Filtering

         Many Commerce API endpoints support filtering. The general syntax is described in [**Filtering**](/guides/Getting-Started/filtering).

         The following attributes and operators are supported.

         | Operator | Attribute | Description | Example |
         | :--- |:---|:---|:---|
         | `eq` | `owner`, `slug` | Equals. Checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are, the condition is true. | `filter=eq(owner,store)` |
         | `in` | `slug`          | In. Checks if a value exists in a given list of values. If the value matches any item in the list, the condition is true. | `filter=in(slug,slug-1,slug-2,slug-3)` |

                    You can specify different modifiers for different options in a variation. When you build child products using options in variations, the properties of a child products depends on the modifier set for the options that are applied to the child product. The table below describes the different types of modifiers.

                    | `description_append` | `string` | Appends the string specified in the modifier to the description of the child product. |
                    | `description_prepend` | `string` | Prepends the string specified in the modifier to the product description of the child product. |
                    | `commodity_type` | `string` | Sets the commodity type of the child product, such as `physical` or `digital`. |
                    | `price` | `string` | Allows application of price modifiers (`price_increment`, `price_decrement`, and `price_equals`) to the child products. |
                    | `price_increment` | `string` | Increases the price of the child product. |
                    | `price_decrement` | `string` | Decreases the price of the child product. |
                    | `price_equals` | `string` | Sets the price of a child product to the amount you specify. |
                    | `slug_append` | `string` | Appends the string specified in the modifier to the slug of the child product. Can only contain A-Z, a-z, 0 to 9, hyphen, underscore, and period. Spaces or other special characters like ^, [], *, and $ are not allowed. However, for the `slug-builder` modifier, you can use `{}` in the `seek` field, for example, `"seek": :{COLOR}"`. |

                    - If you don’t provide `sort_order` when creating nodes, all child nodes in the response for `Get a Node’s Children` request are ordered by the `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently updated child node first.
