# Getting Started With Schematics

This repository is a basic Schematic implementation that serves as a starting point to create and publish Schematics to NPM.

### Testing

To test locally, install `composable-cli` globally and use the `composable-cli` command line tool.

Check the documentation with

```bash
composable-cli --help
```

### Unit Testing

`yarn run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

### Publishing

To publish, simply do:

```bash
yarn run build
yarn publish
```

That's it!
