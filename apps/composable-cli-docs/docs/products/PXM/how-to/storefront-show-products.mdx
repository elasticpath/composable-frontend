# How to display products on your storefront

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to display products in your storefront using the PXM (Product Experience Management) REST API.

## Overview

Using the PXM REST API, you can display products in your storefront with their images, prices, and other information.

### Scenario

You want your customers to be able to see products in your storefront:

- List filtered products
- Display product prices
- Display a single product by ID

## Prerequisites

### Elastic Path Products

It's assumed that you already have an Elastic Path account setup with a published catalog. If not, you can [sign up for a free trial](https://useast.cm.elasticpath.com/free-trial).

It's also assumed you already have a storefront set up. It can be a custom tech stack or using or Composable Starter. If you don’t have a storefront set up, you can use our [Composable Starter](/docs/composable-starter/storefront-starter) to get started.

### JS SDK
This guide includes code snippets to send requests to your Elastic Path products using our JavaScript SDK.

If you follow the JavaScript code blocks, it’s assumed you already have JS SDK installed and have created an instance of the client gateway.

### React Shopper Hooks

This guide also includes code snippets to send requests to your Elastic Path products using React Shopper Hooks.

If you follow the React Shopper Hooks code blocks, it's assumed you already have React Shopper Hooks installed and have used ElasticPathProvider higher in your component tree.

## List Products

You can list products in your storefront using the [PXM catalog view (shopper) endpoints](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/catalogs/shopper-catalog/catalog-shopper-overview).


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js-sdk" label="JS SDK">

    ```typescript
    client.ShopperCatalog.Products.All().then((productPage) => {
      console.log('productPage', productPage)
    })
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="elastic-path-react" label="Elastic Path React">

    ```tsx
    import { useProducts } from "@elasticpath/react-shopper-hooks"

    export default function Products() {
    const { data, meta, isLoading } = useProducts()

      return (
        <div>
          {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
          {data && !data.length && <span>No Products</span>}
          {data && data.length > 0 && (
            <ul>
              {data.map((product) => (
                <li key={product.id}>{product.attributes.title}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          )}
        </div>
      )
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fetch" label="Fetch API">

    ```js
    fetch("https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/catalog/products", {
        headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: "Bearer XXXX"
      }
    }).then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data));
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This endpoint doesn't require any parameters, although it support additional options for pagination, filters and sorting. More explanations can be found in the [API reference](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/catalogs/shopper-catalog/get-all-products)

### Filtering Products

You can filter products by using the `filter` query parameter. For example, to filter products by category, you can use the `category` filter:

## Get Product by ID

You can get a single product in your storefront using the [PXM catalog view (shopper) endpoints, get a product](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/catalogs/shopper-catalog/get-a-product).


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js-sdk" label="JS SDK">

    ```typescript
    client.ShopperCatalog.Products.Get({productId: productId}).then((product) => {
      console.log(product.id)
  })
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="elastic-path-react" label="Elastic Path React">

    ```tsx
    import { useProduct } from "@elasticpath/react-shopper-hooks"

    export default function Products() {
    const { data: product, isLoading } = useProduct()

    return (
      <div>
        {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
        {product && <span>{product.attributes.name}</span>}
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fetch" label="Fetch API">

    ```js
    fetch("https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/catalog/products/${productId}", {
        headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: "Bearer XXXX"
      }
    }).then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data));
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Returns the specified product from the catalog. The product must be in the live status.

If you have multiple catalog rules defined, the rule that best matches the shopperʼs context is used to determine which catalog is retrieved. For information about how rules are matched, see [Resolving Catalog Rules](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/catalogs/shopper-catalog/catalog-shopper-overview#resolving-catalog-rules).

You can see the parent nodes a product is associated with in the bread_crumbs and bread_crumb_nodes metadata for each product. This is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store, for example. For more information, see [Catalog Releases Overview](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-latest-release/overview).
