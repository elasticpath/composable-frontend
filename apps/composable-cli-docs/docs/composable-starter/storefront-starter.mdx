# Getting started with Composable Starter

Composable Starter is the toolkit recommended by Elastic Path for creating headless commerce storefronts. It includes a set of practical components, tools, and utilities that reflect Elastic Path's best practices for building custom web storefronts.

## What you’ll build

You’re going to complete the following tasks:

- Creating a new Composable Starter (Next.js) app using the Composable CLI
- Running your storefront in your local development environment
- Setting up continuous deployment with GitHub and Vercel
- Deploying your app to production

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- You've installed a Node.js package manager: either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Latest [composable-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/composable-cli)
- You've installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Elastic Path account
You'll also need an Elastic Path account to access the backend. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a free trial](https://useast.cm.elasticpath.com/free-trial).

### Install Composable CLI globally and authenticate

You'll need to install the latest version of composable-cli to get started. You can do this by running the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">

    ```bash
    pnpm add -g @composable/cli
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    ```bash
    npm install -g @composable/cli
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    ```bash
    yarn global add @composable/cli
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then authenticate with Elastic Path by running the following command:

```bash
ep login
```

For further explanation see [Authentication](/docs/composable-cli/installation#authentication).

## Create a new Composable Starter app

In your terminal, run the following command to create a new Composable Starter app:

```bash
ep generate d2c my-storefront
```

## Running the storefront locally

The Composable Starter app is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Your local developer experience will be the same as any Next.js app. To learn more about Next.js, see the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

To run your storefront locally, run the following command from your project directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your Next.js Elastic Path powered storefront will run at `http://localhost:3000` (look at the terminal output for the exact URL as your local environment may be different).
