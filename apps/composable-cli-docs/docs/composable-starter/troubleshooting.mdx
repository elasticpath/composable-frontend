## Failed configuration tasks
One of my configuration tasks failed. What should I do?

If one or more of your configuration tasks failed you can retry them by running the appropriate CLI command from your project directory:

e.g. Algolia configuration:

```bash
ep int algolia
```

e.g. Elastic Path Payments configuration:

```bash
ep payments ep-payments
```

full list of available configuration tasks can be found in the [Composable CLI docs](/docs/composable-cli/commands).
