# simple Elastic Path storefront starter

This project was generated with [Composable CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/composable-cli).

This storefront accelerates the development of a direct-to-consumer ecommerce experience using Elastic Path's modular products.

## Tech Stack

- [Elastic Path](https://www.elasticpath.com/products): A family of composable products for businesses that need to quickly & easily create unique experiences and next-level customer engagements that drive revenue.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): a React framework for building static and server-side rendered applications

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): enabling you to get started with a range of out the box components that are
  easy to customize

- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/): completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate
  beautifully with Tailwind CSS.

- [Radix UI Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives): Unstyled, accessible, open source React primitives for high-quality web apps and design systems.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will hot reload as you edit the file.

## Deployment

Deployment is typical for a Next.js site. We recommend using a provider
like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/11/30/how-to-deploy-next.js-sites-to-netlify/)
or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs) to get full Next.js feature support.
