## Overview

This example shows:

- How to fetch and display a list of products from Elastic Path
- How to show product details including images, pricing, and stock information
- How to implement basic product navigation (list â†’ detail view)
- How to handle product metadata like SEO information
- Basic authentication flow required for Elastic Path API access

## Features

### Product Listing
- Displays products in a responsive grid layout
- Shows product images, names, and descriptions
- Includes authentication status indicator
- Handles empty state when no products are available

### Product Details
- Individual product pages with detailed information
- Displays product images, descriptions, SKUs, pricing, and stock levels
- Implements proper SEO metadata (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter cards)
- Includes structured data (JSON-LD) for search engines
- Navigation back to product listing

## How the SDK is Used

The example uses the `@epcc-sdk/sdks-shopper` package to:

1. **Fetch product listings**: Using `getByContextAllProducts` to retrieve all products with main images
2. **Fetch individual products**: Using `getByContextProduct` to get detailed product information
3. **Extract product images**: Using `extractProductImage` helper to get main product images
4. **Handle authentication**: Basic server-side authentication for API access (see other examples for detailed auth patterns)

## Getting Started
