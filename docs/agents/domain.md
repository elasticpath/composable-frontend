# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

**Layout: single-context.** One glossary and one ADR folder at the repo root cover every package and example. The examples share one domain, Elastic Path Commerce, so they share one vocabulary.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-<decision>.md
│   └── 0002-<decision>.md
├── examples/
├── packages/
└── apps/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
